<SYNC Start=14040><P Class=KRCC>There are cabinet members<br>who question whether you're fit
<SYNC Start=16998><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=17120><P Class=KRCC>to continue as chief executive of this country.
<SYNC Start=19918><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=20040><P Class=KRCC>We are invoking the 25th Amendment.
<SYNC Start=22349><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=22480><P Class=KRCC>I intend to show your erratic and irrational<br>behaviour since the start of this crisis.
<SYNC Start=28237><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=28360><P Class=KRCC>You see the results. The vote is against you.
<SYNC Start=30635><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=30760><P Class=KRCC>Please remove yourself from<br>the decision-making process.
<SYNC Start=33832><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=33960><P Class=KRCC>I swear that I will faithfully execute the<br>office of the President of the United States,
<SYNC Start=38670><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=38800><P Class=KRCC>so help me God.
<SYNC Start=40074><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=40200><P Class=KRCC>I got a message that the president<br>called off the military offensive.
<SYNC Start=44591><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=44720><P Class=KRCC>- Is it true?<br>- Yes.
<SYNC Start=45869><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=46000><P Class=KRCC>- You knew about it?<br>- I did.
<SYNC Start=47479><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=47600><P Class=KRCC>Why keep my people processing<br>intel on a scrapped operation?
<SYNC Start=51559><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=51680><P Class=KRCC>There's a strong possibility<br>the White House will reinstate the attack.
<SYNC Start=55593><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=55720><P Class=KRCC>- Dad?<br>- Sweetheart.
<SYNC Start=57870><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=58000><P Class=KRCC>- I've been trying to reach you.<br>- Are you at the sheriff's station?
<SYNC Start=61959><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=62080><P Class=KRCC>They're taking me to the Mathesons' house<br>to pack up my things. Glad you're OK.
<SYNC Start=66198><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=66320><P Class=KRCC>Me too.
<SYNC Start=67514><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=67640><P Class=KRCC>- Have you got the audio file?<br>- No.
<SYNC Start=69392><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=69520><P Class=KRCC>Are you saying there's<br>no audio file on that chip?
<SYNC Start=73069><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=73200><P Class=KRCC>If there were, they were destroyed.
<SYNC Start=75191><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=75320><P Class=KRCC>Michelle traced the sequence<br>to a hacker named Alex Hewitt.
<SYNC Start=78630><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=78760><P Class=KRCC>- He created the Cyprus audio file?<br>- Yes.
<SYNC Start=82389><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=84480><P Class=KRCC>(Jack) I'm checking up on a man<br>who engineered the recording.
<SYNC Start=87950><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=88080><P Class=KRCC>(Palmer) Are you convinced<br>that the Cyprus recording is forged?
<SYNC Start=91550><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=91680><P Class=KRCC>(Jack) Yes, sir, without a doubt.
<SYNC Start=94478><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=94600><P Class=KRCC>Alex?
<SYNC Start=96556><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=108960><P Class=KRCC>- Hewitt's not here.<br>- I'm not surprised.
<SYNC Start=111633><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=111760><P Class=KRCC>Check the garage, see if his car's still here.
<SYNC Start=114957><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=136920><P Class=KRCC>Even with the delay, we predict<br>we have not lost the element of surprise.
<SYNC Start=140595><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=140720><P Class=KRCC>As you can see here, sir, the primary<br>targets are still relatively unguarded.
<SYNC Start=145316><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=145440><P Class=KRCC>Resistance should be insignificant.
<SYNC Start=148034><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=148160><P Class=KRCC>- When were these pictures taken?<br>- Ten minutes ago, sir.
<SYNC Start=151755><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=152600><P Class=KRCC>Then we can proceed<br>with the attack as planned.
<SYNC Start=155034><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=155160><P Class=KRCC>Yes, Mr President.
<SYNC Start=157196><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=168400><P Class=KRCC>I need your key codes, sir.
<SYNC Start=170630><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=177400><P Class=KRCC>How much longer will Prescott detain me?
<SYNC Start=179630><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=179760><P Class=KRCC>Until after the press conference.
<SYNC Start=182399><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=182520><P Class=KRCC>In a couple of hours, he's going<br>to announce the US response to the bomb,
<SYNC Start=186308><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=186440><P Class=KRCC>and his ascension to the office.
<SYNC Start=189000><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=190480><P Class=KRCC>Your key codes belong<br>to President Prescott now. It's protocol.
<SYNC Start=195838><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=230480><P Class=KRCC>Confirmed.
<SYNC Start=232436><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=257880><P Class=KRCC>Know why Chappelle called this meeting?
<SYNC Start=259836><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=259960><P Class=KRCC>No, he just told everybody<br>to save their work and get in here.
<SYNC Start=263919><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=265400><P Class=KRCC>This information is confidential.
<SYNC Start=267595><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=267720><P Class=KRCC>It'll stay inside until it's been made public,<br>which should be in the next few hours.
<SYNC Start=272271><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=272400><P Class=KRCC>The cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment<br>and removed David Palmer from office.
<SYNC Start=276473><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=276600><P Class=KRCC>- Jim Prescott is now the president.<br>- Why?
<SYNC Start=279956><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=280080><P Class=KRCC>That isn't relevant to our charge.
<SYNC Start=282799><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=282920><P Class=KRCC>- Yes, it is, Ryan.<br>- What's your problem, Almeida?
<SYNC Start=285753><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=285880><P Class=KRCC>We know Palmer was removed cos<br>he didn't wanna go on with the bombings.
<SYNC Start=289589><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=289720><P Class=KRCC>That makes what Bauer's<br>doing more relevant.
<SYNC Start=292154><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=292280><P Class=KRCC>Bauer has cried wolf twice already.<br>He's come up with nothing.
<SYNC Start=296068><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=296200><P Class=KRCC>I have an order from District<br>that disallows any further resources
<SYNC Start=299556><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=299680><P Class=KRCC>from being expended on him.
<SYNC Start=301398><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=301520><P Class=KRCC>Why is everybody so afraid to look at all<br>the sides of this? What if Bauer's right?
<SYNC Start=305718><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=305840><P Class=KRCC>What if it was forged and we're about<br>to bomb three innocent countries?
<SYNC Start=309833><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=309960><P Class=KRCC>Tony, let me first say that your office<br>has done a remarkable job today.
<SYNC Start=314192><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=314320><P Class=KRCC>There is no way the people on the Hill<br>are not going to reward every one of you
<SYNC Start=318029><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=318160><P Class=KRCC>for your role in averting disaster.
<SYNC Start=320355><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=320480><P Class=KRCC>- What does that have to do with anything?<br>- Let me finish.
<SYNC Start=324029><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=324160><P Class=KRCC>The success of this office today<br>is due in large part to the technical team.
<SYNC Start=328472><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=328600><P Class=KRCC>The same team that has concluded<br>that the Cyprus audio
<SYNC Start=331876><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=332000><P Class=KRCC>is an untreated, unforged original.
<SYNC Start=335117><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=335240><P Class=KRCC>There comes a time when you have<br>to let go. Not every hunch works out.
<SYNC Start=340792><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=340920><P Class=KRCC>Bauer's chasing a ghost.<br>I can't put it any simpler than that.
<SYNC Start=346153><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=346280><P Class=KRCC>That's all.
<SYNC Start=347952><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=352080><P Class=KRCC>- What are you gonna do?<br>- I have to talk to one of Prescott's staff.
<SYNC Start=355550><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=355680><P Class=KRCC>If Jack comes in with the evidence,<br>we need somebody in place to take it to.
<SYNC Start=359878><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=360000><P Class=KRCC>If Chappelle finds out<br>you're doing an end run...
<SYNC Start=362753><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=362880><P Class=KRCC>I know. I know.
<SYNC Start=365440><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=371960><P Class=KRCC>- The car is gone.<br>- OK.
<SYNC Start=374235><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=374360><P Class=KRCC>- (man) What do you wanna do?<br>- (Sherry) Kingsley took anything important.
<SYNC Start=378990><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=379120><P Class=KRCC>- (Sherry) We gotta find Hewitt. Let's go.<br>- Stop right there!
<SYNC Start=383272><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=384440><P Class=KRCC>- Sit down!<br>- Let go of me!
<SYNC Start=386795><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=386920><P Class=KRCC>Don't move. Don't move!
<SYNC Start=389878><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=390000><P Class=KRCC>Who are you? Don't look at her,<br>look at me! Who are you?
<SYNC Start=393879><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=394000><P Class=KRCC>- I'm nobody.<br>- He's my private bodyguard.
<SYNC Start=396798><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=396920><P Class=KRCC>- Secret Service?<br>- Ex.
<SYNC Start=400151><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=404760><P Class=KRCC>- Mrs Palmer.<br>- Jack Bauer.
<SYNC Start=407354><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=408200><P Class=KRCC>- Stand up.<br>- Why?
<SYNC Start=410156><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=410280><P Class=KRCC>- Stand up!<br>- What are you gonna do to me?
<SYNC Start=412316><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=412440><P Class=KRCC>Turn around.
<SYNC Start=414715><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=414840><P Class=KRCC>I'm not carrying any weapons.
<SYNC Start=417479><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=419200><P Class=KRCC>Take a seat.
<SYNC Start=421191><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=434880><P Class=KRCC>- Why are you here?<br>- Trying to help David.
<SYNC Start=437155><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=437280><P Class=KRCC>- You're no longer part of his life.<br>- Don't believe everything you read.
<SYNC Start=441239><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=441360><P Class=KRCC>David's asked me to pool my resources to<br>see if I can find out who's behind the bomb.
<SYNC Start=447833><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=447960><P Class=KRCC>- I don't believe you.<br>- I don't care what you believe.
<SYNC Start=451748><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=458960><P Class=KRCC>Do you know who did this?<br>Who ransacked this place?
<SYNC Start=462589><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=462720><P Class=KRCC>- You're here for the same reason I am.<br>- What reason would that be?
<SYNC Start=467077><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=467200><P Class=KRCC>- To find Alex Hewitt.<br>- Why?
<SYNC Start=470158><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=470280><P Class=KRCC>- You must know. You're here.<br>- Why don't you tell me?
<SYNC Start=473829><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=473960><P Class=KRCC>He created a recording<br>that's about to start a war.
<SYNC Start=478192><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=488280><P Class=KRCC>How do you know about that?
<SYNC Start=489679><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=489800><P Class=KRCC>I don't like the way<br>this conversation is going.
<SYNC Start=492439><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=492560><P Class=KRCC>- How do you know about Cyprus audio?<br>- How dare you talk down to me!
<SYNC Start=496348><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=496480><P Class=KRCC>I am not a politician.<br>I will not debate this with you.
<SYNC Start=499278><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=499400><P Class=KRCC>Answer me. What do you know<br>about the Cyprus recording?
<SYNC Start=502437><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=502560><P Class=KRCC>Every expert in the government<br>with priority clearance
<SYNC Start=506030><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=506160><P Class=KRCC>has been working on it for six hours.<br>I've got a lot of sources.
<SYNC Start=509516><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=509640><P Class=KRCC>- What do you know about Alex Hewitt?<br>- That he's a freelance audio technician.
<SYNC Start=514873><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=515000><P Class=KRCC>- Who does he work for?<br>- A man named Peter Kingsley.
<SYNC Start=517639><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=517760><P Class=KRCC>Why?
<SYNC Start=519079><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=519200><P Class=KRCC>Kingsley represents Caspian Sea<br>oils interests that want the US
<SYNC Start=522590><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=522720><P Class=KRCC>at war with the Middle East. Kingsley hired<br>Hewitt to fabricate the Cyprus recording.
<SYNC Start=527475><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=527600><P Class=KRCC>Mr Bauer, I've walked the corridors<br>of power my entire life.
<SYNC Start=530990><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=531120><P Class=KRCC>You'd be surprised how much information<br>you can get if you have something to trade.
<SYNC Start=535557><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=535680><P Class=KRCC>- What are you doing?<br>- Take a seat.
<SYNC Start=539275><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=540920><P Class=KRCC>Take a seat!
<SYNC Start=543070><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=557800><P Class=KRCC>Come out!
<SYNC Start=560633><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=561880><P Class=KRCC>Open the door slowly,<br>I wanna see both your hands! Now! Now!
<SYNC Start=565759><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=565880><P Class=KRCC>Please don't hurt me!
<SYNC Start=567836><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=567960><P Class=KRCC>- Get on the ground!<br>- OK. OK.
<SYNC Start=569916><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=570040><P Class=KRCC>Don't move. Get on the ground!<br>Who are you?

<SYNC Start=574995><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=575120><P Class=KRCC>You said you would help me.<br>Why does he have a gun?
<SYNC Start=577588><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=577720><P Class=KRCC>- Shut up. Go sit with her.<br>- I didn't do anything wrong.
<SYNC Start=580712><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=580840><P Class=KRCC>- Move!<br>- You said you'd...
<SYNC Start=582239><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp

<SYNC Start=585113><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp

<SYNC Start=586958><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp

<SYNC Start=589230><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp

<SYNC Start=591828><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=592920><P Class=KRCC>You're gonna talk to me now.
<SYNC Start=594876><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=608680><P Class=KRCC>You took voice samples from three leaders<br>and intercut them with Ali's for the audio?
<SYNC Start=613390><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=613520><P Class=KRCC>- I didn't say that.<br>- And Kingsley paid you.
<SYNC Start=615795><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=615920><P Class=KRCC>- No!<br>- You're a traitor.
<SYNC Start=618115><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=618240><P Class=KRCC>- You know what they'll do to you?<br>- I'm not. I didn't know, I swear.
<SYNC Start=621994><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=622120><P Class=KRCC>I told Mrs Palmer. She'll tell you.
<SYNC Start=623997><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=624120><P Class=KRCC>Forget about her. She can't help you.
<SYNC Start=626236><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=626360><P Class=KRCC>But if you tell me everything about<br>the Cyprus audio, I'll do what I can.
<SYNC Start=630319><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=630440><P Class=KRCC>- I won't say anything until I see a lawyer.<br>- I am your lawyer, son.
<SYNC Start=634115><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=634240><P Class=KRCC>Those people you worked for thought<br>you'd die in the bomb. They're after you.
<SYNC Start=639155><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=639280><P Class=KRCC>If you wanna stay alive,<br>start telling me everything.
<SYNC Start=642795><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=642920><P Class=KRCC>No, I only wanna talk to Mrs Palmer.
<SYNC Start=644876><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=648280><P Class=KRCC>Why her? How's she connected to this?<br>How do you know her?
<SYNC Start=653434><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=653560><P Class=KRCC>I just met her today.<br>She called, said she could help me.

<SYNC Start=656720><P Class=KRCC>I know she's the president's ex-wife.<br>She's got connections high up.
<SYNC Start=661271><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=661400><P Class=KRCC>She can't help you now, Alex.<br>I'm the only one who can help you now.

<SYNC Start=682394><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp

<SYNC Start=689590><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=692320><P Class=KRCC>Just step back.
<SYNC Start=694550><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp

<SYNC Start=706800><P Class=KRCC>Please don't tell me it's to help the president.
<SYNC Start=709792><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=709920><P Class=KRCC>All right. I came here to protect myself.
<SYNC Start=713708><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=714400><P Class=KRCC>Alex was paid by Kingsley<br>to record certain conversations.

<SYNC Start=726916><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=727040><P Class=KRCC>What were you thinking?<br>What the hell were you thinking?
<SYNC Start=730510><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=730640><P Class=KRCC>- Who are you calling?<br>- CTU.
<SYNC Start=732790><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=732920><P Class=KRCC>I'm a sworn federal agent.<br>You just confessed to a federal crime.
<SYNC Start=736196><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=736320><P Class=KRCC>- I suggest you hang up that phone.<br>- I need to speak to Tony Almeida.
<SYNC Start=740393><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=740520><P Class=KRCC>I am the only one<br>who can get Hewitt to cooperate.
<SYNC Start=743080><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp

<SYNC Start=746829><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=747680><P Class=KRCC>Now hang up the phone<br>and I'll tell you everything.
<SYNC Start=751116><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=752040><P Class=KRCC>- Jack, it's Tony, what's going on?<br>- I'm gonna have to get back to you.
<SYNC Start=757034><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=760440><P Class=KRCC>Start.
<SYNC Start=761839><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=766400><P Class=KRCC>- Start!<br>- I wanted to bring down David's presidency.
<SYNC Start=770598><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=770720><P Class=KRCC>I was so angry with David<br>for what he did to me.
<SYNC Start=773757><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=773880><P Class=KRCC>I worked tirelessly for years to put him<br>into office. I sacrificed everything.
<SYNC Start=778874><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=779000><P Class=KRCC>My career, my family. David betrayed me.
<SYNC Start=783039><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=783160><P Class=KRCC>So you wanted revenge.<br>What did Kingsley want?
<SYNC Start=786436><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=788440><P Class=KRCC>Money. A war in the Middle East<br>would triple the value of his oil.
<SYNC Start=791989><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=792120><P Class=KRCC>You're here to ensure<br>no one connects you to Kingsley.
<SYNC Start=794953><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=795080><P Class=KRCC>Yes, like I told you, I came to protect myself.
<SYNC Start=798516><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=798640><P Class=KRCC>Look, Mr Bauer, there's only one person<br>you need to prosecute for this.
<SYNC Start=802713><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=802840><P Class=KRCC>And that person is sitting in that room there.
<SYNC Start=806071><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=806200><P Class=KRCC>I want full immunity.
<SYNC Start=809237><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=809920><P Class=KRCC>Otherwise, it's just your word against mine.
<SYNC Start=813879><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=832160><P Class=KRCC>She'll talk with you.
<SYNC Start=834390><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=841600><P Class=KRCC>- I know you're scared.<br>- You said I would be OK.
<SYNC Start=844319><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=844440><P Class=KRCC>I know there's been a little wrinkle,<br>but we can fix that.
<SYNC Start=847876><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=848680><P Class=KRCC>What do you think, Aaron? You think<br>I'm unfit to fulfil my duties as president?
<SYNC Start=853674><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=854240><P Class=KRCC>Sir, I'm under orders<br>not to discuss this with you.

<SYNC Start=860716><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=862720><P Class=KRCC>- No, sir.<br>- Good.
<SYNC Start=864676><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=866120><P Class=KRCC>Then I'll do all the talking.<br>I assume you remember Jack Bauer.
<SYNC Start=870671><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=870800><P Class=KRCC>He believes the Cyprus recording,
<SYNC Start=872597><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=872720><P Class=KRCC>the single piece of evidence<br>propelling us into this war,
<SYNC Start=876030><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=876160><P Class=KRCC>was fabricated.
<SYNC Start=878196><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=878320><P Class=KRCC>I've been removed from office<br>because I believe in Bauer.
<SYNC Start=882598><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=882720><P Class=KRCC>If it wasn't for Jack, Los Angeles<br>would be a killing field by now.
<SYNC Start=887316><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=887440><P Class=KRCC>Still, Prescott and the cabinet<br>refuse to believe that he might be right.
<SYNC Start=892719><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=894160><P Class=KRCC>If Jack finds the evidence after the planes<br>have dropped their payloads,
<SYNC Start=898676><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=898800><P Class=KRCC>then it'll be too late.
<SYNC Start=900836><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=900960><P Class=KRCC>We will be at war against<br>three innocent countries.
<SYNC Start=903918><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=905520><P Class=KRCC>I'm sure if Jack Bauer finds evidence,<br>Vice President Prescott...
<SYNC Start=910389><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=910520><P Class=KRCC>I mean, the president, will recall the bombers.
<SYNC Start=914991><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=917760><P Class=KRCC>- You're under orders not to speak to me.<br>- I'm doing my best, sir.
<SYNC Start=922629><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=922760><P Class=KRCC>- Your best would be to help me.<br>- By doing what?
<SYNC Start=926116><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=928320><P Class=KRCC>I need to talk to Jack Bauer.<br>Find out if he's secured the evidence.
<SYNC Start=932438><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=943200><P Class=KRCC>If I remember correctly,<br>you have a son in the Navy.
<SYNC Start=946909><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=947040><P Class=KRCC>Yes, sir, I do.
<SYNC Start=949349><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=950880><P Class=KRCC>It's a fine thing to defend one's country.<br>You should be proud.
<SYNC Start=956034><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=956800><P Class=KRCC>Let's make sure the cause<br>he's fighting for is the just one.
<SYNC Start=960076><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=962600><P Class=KRCC>Get me a sat phone. I need a secure line.
<SYNC Start=966479><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=969440><P Class=KRCC>Put these in the overnight database.<br>Chappelle's gonna need 'em for his briefing.
<SYNC Start=974594><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=974720><P Class=KRCC>Why are you giving this to me?<br>This is your situation report.
<SYNC Start=977837><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=977960><P Class=KRCC>I'm on something else.
<SYNC Start=980428><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=980560><P Class=KRCC>What else?
<SYNC Start=982516><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=983360><P Class=KRCC>I don't have to explain myself<br>to you, Carrie. Just do it.
<SYNC Start=986750><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=986880><P Class=KRCC>You do need to explain yourself
<SYNC Start=989189><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=989320><P Class=KRCC>cos I think you're going behind<br>Chappelle's back, trying to help Jack Bauer.
<SYNC Start=994474><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=996960><P Class=KRCC>Do you really wanna do this, Carrie?<br>Come after me?
<SYNC Start=1000111><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1000240><P Class=KRCC>I've been letting you get away with a lot,<br>but if you want the gloves to come off, fine.
<SYNC Start=1005792><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1009320><P Class=KRCC>What's going on here?
<SYNC Start=1010833><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1010960><P Class=KRCC>She's asking me to take on some of<br>her workload. I just wanna know why.
<SYNC Start=1015750><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1015880><P Class=KRCC>Why don't you wanna tell her?
<SYNC Start=1017836><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1021920><P Class=KRCC>It's none of her business, Tony.
<SYNC Start=1024115><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1024240><P Class=KRCC>Look, just tell her, so we can<br>get back to work here.
<SYNC Start=1027994><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1030160><P Class=KRCC>All right.
<SYNC Start=1032116><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1032240><P Class=KRCC>District's asked me to step in as a liaison<br>to facilitate the power shift.
<SYNC Start=1036119><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1036240><P Class=KRCC>I'll be on the phone for the next two hours.
<SYNC Start=1039516><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1039640><P Class=KRCC>Sounds like a promotion. Congratulations.
<SYNC Start=1042677><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1047840><P Class=KRCC>- You think she believed me?<br>- No.
<SYNC Start=1051276><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1057800><P Class=KRCC>Go over it again.<br>Look, I need you to find it fast,
<SYNC Start=1062191><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1062320><P Class=KRCC>even if you need to pull agents who can<br>help you. This needs to take first priority.
<SYNC Start=1066916><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1067040><P Class=KRCC>Division's breathing down<br>my neck for some reason.
<SYNC Start=1069793><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1069920><P Class=KRCC>- That's something I don't need.<br>- I'll take care of it.
<SYNC Start=1072832><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1072960><P Class=KRCC>All right.
<SYNC Start=1074518><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1074640><P Class=KRCC>- Mr Chappelle.<br>- Yes, Carrie?
<SYNC Start=1076631><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1077320><P Class=KRCC>In my opinion, Tony Almeida's<br>not fit to run CTU.
<SYNC Start=1080039><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1081120><P Class=KRCC>- Why not?<br>- He's got Michelle working off book.
<SYNC Start=1084396><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1084520><P Class=KRCC>- Doing what?<br>- I can't say for sure.
<SYNC Start=1086556><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1086680><P Class=KRCC>But I have a feeling the two of them<br>are still trying to help Bauer.
<SYNC Start=1091117><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1092160><P Class=KRCC>Thank you.
<SYNC Start=1094116><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1108280><P Class=KRCC>(Sherry) It'll be fine.
<SYNC Start=1110111><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1113080><P Class=KRCC>- (phone ringing)<br>- Here you go, thanks.
<SYNC Start=1116038><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1116160><P Class=KRCC>- Almeida.<br>- Tony, it's Jack.
<SYNC Start=1117912><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1118040><P Class=KRCC>- What's happening?<br>- President still holding off on the attack?
<SYNC Start=1121635><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1121760><P Class=KRCC>Things have gotten worse.<br>It's not public, but Palmer's been pulled.
<SYNC Start=1125230><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1125360><P Class=KRCC>- What do you mean?<br>- His cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment
<SYNC Start=1128511><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1128640><P Class=KRCC>because he wanted to wait<br>for confirmation of the recording.
<SYNC Start=1131916><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1132040><P Class=KRCC>Prescott's now president.
<SYNC Start=1133996><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1134120><P Class=KRCC>I'll bring evidence proving the recording's<br>been forged. Prescott won't listen to it?
<SYNC Start=1138910><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1139040><P Class=KRCC>He won't wait for it. Get me that evidence<br>quickly, and I'll call Prescott with it.
<SYNC Start=1143556><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1143680><P Class=KRCC>Start by sending a chopper<br>to the address you gave me.
<SYNC Start=1146433><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1146560><P Class=KRCC>- I got Hewitt.<br>- He definitely made the recording?
<SYNC Start=1149154><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1149280><P Class=KRCC>- Yes, absolutely.<br>- Will he testify?
<SYNC Start=1152078><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1153600><P Class=KRCC>We're working on it.
<SYNC Start=1155113><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1155240><P Class=KRCC>If I go to Chappelle and request<br>a chopper for you, he'll deny it.
<SYNC Start=1158437><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1158560><P Class=KRCC>- He's got orders from District.<br>- Deal with it, Tony.
<SYNC Start=1161552><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1161680><P Class=KRCC>We got bombers in the air.<br>Hewitt's our only chance of stopping this.
<SYNC Start=1165275><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1165400><P Class=KRCC>I'll do my best.
<SYNC Start=1166355><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1166480><P Class=KRCC>OK, thanks, Tony.
<SYNC Start=1168152><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1168280><P Class=KRCC>I know, Alex. I understand your concern.
<SYNC Start=1170919><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1171040><P Class=KRCC>But the fact remains, we both made a mistake.
<SYNC Start=1174749><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1174880><P Class=KRCC>But we're lucky because they need us.
<SYNC Start=1177678><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1177800><P Class=KRCC>Any deal I make will include you, and vice<br>versa. Remember, we're in this together.
<SYNC Start=1183397><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1183520><P Class=KRCC>Are you sure about this?
<SYNC Start=1185476><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1185600><P Class=KRCC>Honey, I would never lie to you.<br>But you have to remember this one thing.
<SYNC Start=1189912><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1190040><P Class=KRCC>I am the only one looking after<br>your interest. No one else.
<SYNC Start=1194238><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1194360><P Class=KRCC>I know how these things work.<br>Just do as I say, and it'll all turn out well.
<SYNC Start=1198717><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1198840><P Class=KRCC>What about him?
<SYNC Start=1200319><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1200440><P Class=KRCC>Don't worry about him. I'll handle<br>Agent Bauer. He won't be a problem.
<SYNC Start=1204319><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1204440><P Class=KRCC>He's very low on the food chain.
<SYNC Start=1206396><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1208320><P Class=KRCC>So, if I do this, you can keep me out ofjail?
<SYNC Start=1211676><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1211800><P Class=KRCC>Absolutely. You'll be granted<br>full immunity just like I promised.
<SYNC Start=1215998><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1216120><P Class=KRCC>OK?
<SYNC Start=1218076><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1225720><P Class=KRCC>All right, Jack, this is how it's gonna work.<br>He'll come in and testify.
<SYNC Start=1230111><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1230240><P Class=KRCC>He can demonstrate the technology<br>in a matter of minutes.
<SYNC Start=1234074><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1236400><P Class=KRCC>Good. The chopper's on its way.
<SYNC Start=1240313><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1247360><P Class=KRCC>You heard Chappelle. He won't let us<br>have a chopper if he knows it's for Jack.
<SYNC Start=1251194><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1251320><P Class=KRCC>But Jack's got Hewitt,<br>who definitely made that recording.
<SYNC Start=1254471><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1254600><P Class=KRCC>- Chappelle can't ignore that.<br>- He can do whatever he wants.
<SYNC Start=1258639><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1258760><P Class=KRCC>Yeah. Mm-hm. OK.
<SYNC Start=1262116><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1263160><P Class=KRCC>Let me get back to you, Marc.
<SYNC Start=1265515><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1265640><P Class=KRCC>- What?<br>- Jack Bauerjust contacted us.
<SYNC Start=1267949><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1268080><P Class=KRCC>Really? Where is he?
<SYNC Start=1269229><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1269360><P Class=KRCC>- North Hollywood.<br>- What's he doing?
<SYNC Start=1271237><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1271360><P Class=KRCC>He wants to bring in the guy<br>who forged the Cyprus recording.
<SYNC Start=1274432><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1274560><P Class=KRCC>Fine, let him.
<SYNC Start=1275675><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1275800><P Class=KRCC>He's too far away. We need to send a chopper.
<SYNC Start=1278360><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1278440><P Class=KRCC>We've been through this, Tony.<br>I'm done with Bauer.
<SYNC Start=1281193><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1281320><P Class=KRCC>He's chasing a trail that leads nowhere.<br>We're onto other things.
<SYNC Start=1284835><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1284960><P Class=KRCC>More important than the US launching<br>military strikes based on false information?
<SYNC Start=1291149><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1291280><P Class=KRCC>The thing is, Tony, you've been reassigned.
<SYNC Start=1294078><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp

<SYNC Start=1298914><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1299040><P Class=KRCC>I'll let you know in a few days.<br>For now, you can go home.

<SYNC Start=1302400><P Class=KRCC>Ryan, you can't reassign me now.
<SYNC Start=1304391><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1304520><P Class=KRCC>This recording is real. We are going to war.<br>We need to prepare for domestic response.

<SYNC Start=1353348><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1353480><P Class=KRCC>They took the disk that had my comb filter.<br>I'll need to rebuild that file to demonstrate.
<SYNC Start=1358600><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1361120><P Class=KRCC>OK, the tarball has to decompress.<br>It'll take about 20 minutes.

<SYNC Start=1379348><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1379480><P Class=KRCC>That's what she said.

<SYNC Start=1682869><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1683000><P Class=KRCC>And what's that supposed to mean?
<SYNC Start=1684718><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1684840><P Class=KRCC>The truth is, the Cyprus recording was forged.<br>You are right and they are wrong.
<SYNC Start=1689789><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp
<SYNC Start=1689920><P Class=KRCC>The truth is, you're trying<br>to prevent an unnecessary war,
