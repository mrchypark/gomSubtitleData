God forgive me!
<SYNC Start=21543><P Class=EGCC>
Wickedness!
<SYNC Start=23463><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=41743><P Class=EGCC>
"..aught that man may question.
<SYNC Start=44383><P Class=EGCC>
You seem to understand me,
<SYNC Start=46863><P Class=EGCC>
By each at once her chappy finger<br>
laying upon her skinny lip.
<SYNC Start=50663><P Class=EGCC>
You should be women,
<SYNC Start=52823><P Class=EGCC>
and yet your beards forbid me to<br>
interpret that you are so.
<SYNC Start=55903><P Class=EGCC>
Speak, if you can. What are you?
<SYNC Start=59103><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=60583><P Class=EGCC>
All hail, Macbeth. Hail to thee,<br>
Thane of Glamis.
<SYNC Start=65303><P Class=EGCC>
All hail, Macbeth. Hail to thee."

Thank you, lad, thank you.

Wickedness! Wickedness!

<SYNC Start=81543><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, God forgive me!
<SYNC Start=83623><P Class=EGCC>
Perhaps somebody could watch out for<br>
the ambulance?

Mrs Davis, it's Father Gorman.

<SYNC Start=93983><P Class=EGCC>
There isn't much time!
<SYNC Start=95983><P Class=EGCC>
Wickedness! Such wickedness!
<SYNC Start=98983><P Class=EGCC>
I can't die like this!
<SYNC Start=101103><P Class=EGCC>
I must...confess.

<SYNC Start=119063><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=120223><P Class=EGCC>
It must be stopped.

I'll do everything that's necessary.<br>

She's at peace.

(TRAIN HORN)
<SYNC Start=189743><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=211543><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, thank you, Marjory, dear.
<SYNC Start=213903><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=214863><P Class=EGCC>
That does look good.<br>
You've got a letter.
<SYNC Start=217703><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, so I see.
<SYNC Start=219743><P Class=EGCC>
London W2. <br>
Where's that?
<SYNC Start=222063><P Class=EGCC>
Paddington, I believe.
<SYNC Start=223943><P Class=EGCC>
Is it from a secret admirer?
<SYNC Start=226103><P Class=EGCC>
Hardly. Father Gorman's a man of the<br>
cloth, dear.
<SYNC Start=229863><P Class=EGCC>
So I hardly think it's...
<SYNC Start=231983><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=237183><P Class=EGCC>
(READS TO HERSELF)
<SYNC Start=239063><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=242103><P Class=EGCC>
How very strange.
<SYNC Start=243983><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=244863><P Class=EGCC>
What's Rev. 6:8, miss?
<SYNC Start=247063><P Class=EGCC>
It isn't done to read other people's<br>
correspondence, you know.
<SYNC Start=250583><P Class=EGCC>
No, miss.
<SYNC Start=251863><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=252823><P Class=EGCC>
But what's it mean?
<SYNC Start=254903><P Class=EGCC>
It's the Book of Revelation.
<SYNC Start=256783><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=258583><P Class=EGCC>
Chapter Six, verse eight.
<SYNC Start=261183><P Class=EGCC>
"And I looked and beheld a pale<br>
horse.
<SYNC Start=264223><P Class=EGCC>
And his name that sat on him was<br>
Death,
<SYNC Start=266903><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=267823><P Class=EGCC>
and Hell followed with him."
<SYNC Start=270183><P Class=EGCC>
I don't like the sound of that.
<SYNC Start=272303><P Class=EGCC>
Well, it's the Bible, dear. I'm not<br>
sure you're meant to.
<SYNC Start=275623><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=277903><P Class=EGCC>
Morning, miss.<br>
Thank you, Billy, dear.
<SYNC Start=279943><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=287943><P Class=EGCC>
That can't be right.
<SYNC Start=289823><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=291783><P Class=EGCC>
There must be a mistake.<br>
Miss?
<SYNC Start=294223><P Class=EGCC>
Whatever's the matter?<br>
Well...
<SYNC Start=296423><P Class=EGCC>
It's Father Gorman,
<SYNC Start=298543><P Class=EGCC>
the man who just wrote to me.
<SYNC Start=300503><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=302143><P Class=EGCC>
He's been murdered.
<SYNC Start=304063><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=307623><P Class=EGCC>
Inspector Lejeune. I've unseamed<br>
your padre for you,
<SYNC Start=311663><P Class=EGCC>
from nave to chops.
<SYNC Start=313423><P Class=EGCC>
Father Gorman. And?
<SYNC Start=315903><P Class=EGCC>
Well and truly coshed. The first<br>
blow probably killed him.
<SYNC Start=319303><P Class=EGCC>
But whoever did it made sure.
<SYNC Start=321343><P Class=EGCC>
Nasty business.
<SYNC Start=323383><P Class=EGCC>
Nastier than you'd expect for<br>
robbery, Dr Kerrigan.
<SYNC Start=326423><P Class=EGCC>
Was it robbery?<br>
Well, his pockets were turned out
<SYNC Start=328943><P Class=EGCC>
and the lining of his cassock<br>
ripped.
<SYNC Start=330983><P Class=EGCC>
They couldn't have hoped for much.
<SYNC Start=333103><P Class=EGCC>
A parish priest? In my experience,<br>
they're usually as poor as... Quite.
<SYNC Start=338463><P Class=EGCC>
But they battered his head in<br>
to make sure. One would like<br>
to know why.
<SYNC Start=342303><P Class=EGCC>
Anyone come forward?<br>
Yes, as it happens.
<SYNC Start=344703><P Class=EGCC>
Just about to take a statement.
<SYNC Start=346463><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=347703><P Class=EGCC>
"Dear Jane, I send the following for<br>
safe keeping.

Revelations, 6:8.
<SYNC Start=364583><P Class=EGCC>
Will telephone tomorrow evening and<br>
explain.
<SYNC Start=367383><P Class=EGCC>
Yours affectionately,<br>
Patrick Gorman."
<SYNC Start=370463><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=372023><P Class=EGCC>
What do you make of it?
<SYNC Start=374343><P Class=EGCC>
Apart from the biblical reference,<br>
I'm not quite sure<br>
what to make of it...yet.
<SYNC Start=378023><P Class=EGCC>
The names don't mean anything<br>
to you? I'm afraid not.
<SYNC Start=380703><P Class=EGCC>
If I might ask how you knew<br>
Father Gorman?
<SYNC Start=383903><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=385423><P Class=EGCC>
We met during the Great War
<SYNC Start=388303><P Class=EGCC>
at a convalescent home where I was<br>
nursing sister.
<SYNC Start=391543><P Class=EGCC>
He served as chaplain with the<br>
Seventh Royal Irish horse.
<SYNC Start=396223><P Class=EGCC>
Brave chap.<br>
Yes, he was.
<SYNC Start=398223><P Class=EGCC>
When did you see him last?
<SYNC Start=400263><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, not for some years.
<SYNC Start=402303><P Class=EGCC>
But we kept in regular touch.
<SYNC Start=404463><P Class=EGCC>
Why do you think he would send this<br>
to you?
<SYNC Start=407103><P Class=EGCC>
Perhaps he thought someone may wish<br>
to take it from him?
<SYNC Start=410343><P Class=EGCC>
A list of meaningless surnames?
<SYNC Start=412703><P Class=EGCC>
They meant something to Father<br>
Gorman,
<SYNC Start=414783><P Class=EGCC>
and presumably to someone else.
<SYNC Start=417583><P Class=EGCC>
The newspaper said he'd been called<br>
out to attend a dying woman
<SYNC Start=423103><P Class=EGCC>
shortly before he was attacked.<br>
Mrs Davis? That's right.
<SYNC Start=427063><P Class=EGCC>
You've questioned her neighbours<br>
presumably?
<SYNC Start=429703><P Class=EGCC>
Her fellow tenants, yes.
<SYNC Start=431943><P Class=EGCC>
23 Benthall Street is a lodging<br>
house
<SYNC Start=434783><P Class=EGCC>
run by a woman called Coppins.
<SYNC Start=436863><P Class=EGCC>
It's just that, I know from my own<br>
experience,
<SYNC Start=439903><P Class=EGCC>
that people don't always realise the<br>
value of what they have seen.
<SYNC Start=444263><P Class=EGCC>
We have done this sort of thing<br>
before, Miss Marple.
<SYNC Start=447703><P Class=EGCC>
Of course. Forgive me. It's just...
<SYNC Start=449623><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=450583><P Class=EGCC>
Father Gorman was such a good man.
<SYNC Start=452703><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=454063><P Class=EGCC>
It's hard to imagine why anyone would<br>
want to hurt him.
<SYNC Start=457143><P Class=EGCC>
Things have changed, Miss Marple.
<SYNC Start=459663><P Class=EGCC>
Goodness doesn't seem to count for<br>
very much any more.
<SYNC Start=462743><P Class=EGCC>
It's an unforgiving world.
<SYNC Start=465103><P Class=EGCC>
And the city is a long way from<br>
country life.
<SYNC Start=467703><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=469303><P Class=EGCC>
Of course, it is possible, isn't it,<br>
that the dying woman told him<br>
something?
<SYNC Start=473463><P Class=EGCC>
Perhaps he had to get those names<br>
down on paper as soon as he could,<br>
before he forgot them?
<SYNC Start=479583><P Class=EGCC>
Anything's possible, of course. It's<br>
what makes my job so interesting.
<SYNC Start=483463><P Class=EGCC>
I'm sorry to have put you to any<br>
bother. No bother at all.
<SYNC Start=487143><P Class=EGCC>
Very public spirited of you<br>
to come forward.
<SYNC Start=489503><P Class=EGCC>
Father Gorman was a good friend.
<SYNC Start=491943><P Class=EGCC>
He should have justice.<br>
He will, I promise.
<SYNC Start=495463><P Class=EGCC>
We'll find him.
<SYNC Start=497663><P Class=EGCC>
In the meantime, try not to trouble<br>
yourself. No. Goodbye.
<SYNC Start=501423><P Class=EGCC>
Goodbye.

(SIGHS)
<SYNC Start=510263><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=511863><P Class=EGCC>
The officer said Paddington Station.
<SYNC Start=514023><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, thank you.
<SYNC Start=515943><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=530663><P Class=EGCC>
Driver?
<SYNC Start=532103><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=533463><P Class=EGCC>
She was all right Monday week.
<SYNC Start=535663><P Class=EGCC>
She was all right when the gas man<br>
come on the Tuesday.
<SYNC Start=538663><P Class=EGCC>
She was all right on wash day.
<SYNC Start=540743><P Class=EGCC>
Then... That's right.
<SYNC Start=543143><P Class=EGCC>
She come down with the flu.
<SYNC Start=545263><P Class=EGCC>
I told her to rest up, but she would<br>
go out.
<SYNC Start=548383><P Class=EGCC>
It settled on her lungs.
<SYNC Start=550263><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=551143><P Class=EGCC>
Well, what did she do, Mrs Davis?
<SYNC Start=554663><P Class=EGCC>
Till about a month ago,
<SYNC Start=557343><P Class=EGCC>
I think it was customer relations.
<SYNC Start=560663><P Class=EGCC>
Or research.
<SYNC Start=562543><P Class=EGCC>
Some such.
<SYNC Start=564223><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=579823><P Class=EGCC>
Had she been with you long,<br>
Mrs Davis?
<SYNC Start=582343><P Class=EGCC>
About six months. Paid her rent<br>
regular.
<SYNC Start=585663><P Class=EGCC>
Seemed like a nice, quiet,<br>
respectable person.
<SYNC Start=588783><P Class=EGCC>
Though what more I can tell you,<br>
I'm sure I don't know.
<SYNC Start=592103><P Class=EGCC>
Not that I wouldn't be willing to<br>
help, if I could.
<SYNC Start=594583><P Class=EGCC>
Well, thank you, but I do need help.
<SYNC Start=597023><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=598543><P Class=EGCC>
Women know. They feel instinctively<br>
so much more than a man can know.
<SYNC Start=602863><P Class=EGCC>
Don't you think?
<SYNC Start=604983><P Class=EGCC>
When you brought Father Gorman<br>
to her,
<SYNC Start=608383><P Class=EGCC>
was there anything they said that was<br>
perhaps odd to you?
<SYNC Start=612503><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=613863><P Class=EGCC>
Not odd so much as...
<SYNC Start=615783><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=616743><P Class=EGCC>
I heard her say something about<br>
wickedness.
<SYNC Start=619583><P Class=EGCC>
Wickedness? Did she?
<SYNC Start=621743><P Class=EGCC>
Yes... They have to confess, don't<br>
they, Romans?
<SYNC Start=625463><P Class=EGCC>
Before they die.
<SYNC Start=627423><P Class=EGCC>
So I suppose that was it.
<SYNC Start=629543><P Class=EGCC>
Was she an unhappy woman, do you<br>
think?
<SYNC Start=631583><P Class=EGCC>
I wouldn't say so.
<SYNC Start=633583><P Class=EGCC>
Business-like, she was. Methodical.
<SYNC Start=636463><P Class=EGCC>
But nothing worrying her that you<br>
knew of?
<SYNC Start=638463><P Class=EGCC>
No, no.
<SYNC Start=640183><P Class=EGCC>
No.
<SYNC Start=641183><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=642743><P Class=EGCC>
But...
<SYNC Start=644143><P Class=EGCC>
there was that one time.
<SYNC Start=646183><P Class=EGCC>
About a month ago,
<SYNC Start=648463><P Class=EGCC>
she was in the hall by the mirror<br>
putting a coat on for work.
<SYNC Start=651743><P Class=EGCC>
If things aren't all they should be,
<SYNC Start=653943><P Class=EGCC>
it's better not to know, don't you<br>
agree?
<SYNC Start=656103><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=656983><P Class=EGCC>
I'm sure that's right, dear.
<SYNC Start=658903><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=659983><P Class=EGCC>
Everything I've done has always been<br>
perfectly straightforward.
<SYNC Start=663263><P Class=EGCC>
I have nothing to reproach myself<br>
with.
<SYNC Start=665503><P Class=EGCC>
MARPLE: 'What do you think she<br>
meant?'
<SYNC Start=667303><P Class=EGCC>
'I've no idea.
<SYNC Start=669543><P Class=EGCC>
It struck me at the time as being a<br>
queer thing to say.'
<SYNC Start=672903><P Class=EGCC>
But people do come out with 'em.
<SYNC Start=674943><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, yes.
<SYNC Start=676663><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, they do.
<SYNC Start=678583><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=679983><P Class=EGCC>
Yes...
<SYNC Start=681103><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=713783><P Class=EGCC>
The Pale Horse.
<SYNC Start=717463><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=733630><P Class=EGCC>
Mr Osborne?<br>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=735350><P Class=EGCC>
Jane Marple. I wonder if I might<br>
bother you for a moment?
<SYNC Start=738550><P Class=EGCC>
Mrs Coppins said you were waiting in<br>
the street
<SYNC Start=742070><P Class=EGCC>
for the ambulance that attended to<br>
Mrs Davis.
<SYNC Start=744790><P Class=EGCC>
That's right. Jolly cold it was,<br>
too.
<SYNC Start=746830><P Class=EGCC>
Were you a friend of Mrs Davis?<br>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=749710><P Class=EGCC>
No, of Father Gorman.<br>
The priest who...?
<SYNC Start=752230><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=753270><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, I see. Yes, of course.<br>
My condolences.
<SYNC Start=755870><P Class=EGCC>
Thank you. I wondered, perhaps had<br>
you seen anyone loitering about,
<SYNC Start=760870><P Class=EGCC>
watching the house?
<SYNC Start=763070><P Class=EGCC>
Well, I did see someone.<br>
Oh?
<SYNC Start=765030><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=765870><P Class=EGCC>
He was tall.
<SYNC Start=768070><P Class=EGCC>
About 50-ish. Wore his hair rather<br>
long underneath his trilby.
<SYNC Start=772190><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, he had a sort of half-moon scar<br>
about here.
<SYNC Start=775350><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, yes? He struck a match<br>
to light a cigarette.
<SYNC Start=778350><P Class=EGCC>
That's how I noticed.<br>
What was he doing?
<SYNC Start=780110><P Class=EGCC>
Just standing on a corner, smoking.
<SYNC Start=782910><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=784030><P Class=EGCC>
Then the ambulance arrived, and I<br>
got rather caught up in all that.
<SYNC Start=787350><P Class=EGCC>
Did you tell the police?<br>
I mentioned it to the constable.
<SYNC Start=789830><P Class=EGCC>
Not that he paid it much mind.
<SYNC Start=792150><P Class=EGCC>
They seem to think it's a<br>
straightforward case with Father<br>
Gorman. Robbery.
<SYNC Start=795350><P Class=EGCC>
Yes. Yes, they do, don't they?
<SYNC Start=797310><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=798550><P Class=EGCC>
You don't? Well, you see,<br>
on the night he died,
<SYNC Start=801510><P Class=EGCC>
Father Gorman sent me a letter.
<SYNC Start=804190><P Class=EGCC>
He did? Just a list of names,<br>
for the most part.
<SYNC Start=807190><P Class=EGCC>
Well, I shan't keep you any longer,<br>
Mr Osborne.
<SYNC Start=810550><P Class=EGCC>
I've disturbed you enough as it is.<br>
Oh, hardly, no.
<SYNC Start=814630><P Class=EGCC>
I'm just typing up my sales report<br>
for the office.
<SYNC Start=816990><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=818470><P Class=EGCC>
Well, thank you, Mr Osborne.<br>
Oh, not at all.
<SYNC Start=821670><P Class=EGCC>
If there's anything else I can do?
<SYNC Start=823710><P Class=EGCC>
Oh...
<SYNC Start=825150><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=826390><P Class=EGCC>
You know, as a matter of fact,
<SYNC Start=829430><P Class=EGCC>
I rather think there is.
<SYNC Start=831470><P Class=EGCC>
Ormerod, Sandford.
<SYNC Start=833830><P Class=EGCC>
Plenty of those.
<SYNC Start=835870><P Class=EGCC>
Parkinson.
<SYNC Start=837830><P Class=EGCC>
Not uncommon.
<SYNC Start=839830><P Class=EGCC>
Hesketh-Dubois. That's a bit of a<br>
mouthful. Can't be many of them.
<SYNC Start=843830><P Class=EGCC>
Hesketh, Hesketh...
<SYNC Start=845710><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=850350><P Class=EGCC>
Ah, here we are! Hesketh-Dubois.
<SYNC Start=853070><P Class=EGCC>
Lady, no less. Only one in the book.
<SYNC Start=856030><P Class=EGCC>
Outside line, please.<br>
Grosvenor 6457.
<SYNC Start=859830><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=861590><P Class=EGCC>
(ENGAGED TONE)<br>
Engaged.
<SYNC Start=864230><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, good afternoon, is that Lady<br>
Hesketh-Dubois' house? Yes.
<SYNC Start=868190><P Class=EGCC>
May I speak with her, please?
<SYNC Start=870590><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=871830><P Class=EGCC>
Lady Hesketh-Dubois passed away.
<SYNC Start=873870><P Class=EGCC>
"Oh, I'm sorry. When was that?"
<SYNC Start=876470><P Class=EGCC>
Six months ago, early this year.
<SYNC Start=878430><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=879990><P Class=EGCC>
Um, to whom am I speaking, please?
<SYNC Start=882190><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=883270><P Class=EGCC>
This is Mr Mark Easterbrook.
<SYNC Start=885270><P Class=EGCC>
I wonder, could you tell me,
<SYNC Start=887830><P Class=EGCC>
do you remember her ever mentioning<br>
a place called The Pale Horse<br>
in Much Deeping?
<SYNC Start=892950><P Class=EGCC>
"Not to my knowledge, no."
<SYNC Start=894910><P Class=EGCC>
No, no, I see.
<SYNC Start=897110><P Class=EGCC>
Well, I'm so sorry to have troubled<br>
you.
<SYNC Start=899190><P Class=EGCC>
Thank you very much. Bye.
<SYNC Start=901350><P Class=EGCC>
(LINE GOES DEAD)
<SYNC Start=903230><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=911230><P Class=EGCC>
It's such a desolate spot.
<SYNC Start=913750><P Class=EGCC>
I shouldn't have brought you here.<br>
I asked you to.
<SYNC Start=916670><P Class=EGCC>
All the same.<br>
No, thank you for coming with me.
<SYNC Start=920470><P Class=EGCC>
I don't think I should have had the<br>
courage to come here on my own.
<SYNC Start=926430><P Class=EGCC>
Somehow I doubt that. You seem quite<br>
brave indeed.
<SYNC Start=930350><P Class=EGCC>
I don't know about brave, but one<br>
must face things as they are.
<SYNC Start=933750><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=935190><P Class=EGCC>
The truth, however awful, can never<br>
be as bad as...
<SYNC Start=938910><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=940030><P Class=EGCC>
..one's imaginings.
<SYNC Start=942070><P Class=EGCC>
I suppose not.
<SYNC Start=943790><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=948190><P Class=EGCC>
Did you know her well, Mrs Davis?
<SYNC Start=950390><P Class=EGCC>
Only to nod to in the hall,<br>
I'm afraid.
<SYNC Start=952630><P Class=EGCC>
She seemed perfectly nice, though.<br>
What makes you ask?
<SYNC Start=955750><P Class=EGCC>
I just wondered if you'd ever heard<br>
her mention The Pale Horse.
<SYNC Start=959510><P Class=EGCC>
A pale horse? No. No, I don't<br>
think...
<SYNC Start=961630><P Class=EGCC>
Not, not a pale horse, THE Pale<br>
Horse.
<SYNC Start=964590><P Class=EGCC>
I can't say as I did. What is it?
<SYNC Start=967310><P Class=EGCC>
Well, I believe it's a little hotel,
<SYNC Start=970830><P Class=EGCC>
an inn of some kind
<SYNC Start=973030><P Class=EGCC>
in a little village<br>
called Much Deeping
<SYNC Start=975470><P Class=EGCC>
in Hampshire.
<SYNC Start=977350><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=999910><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, hello?
<SYNC Start=1001710><P Class=EGCC>
Hello?
<SYNC Start=1003630><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1048590><P Class=EGCC>
Will you be staying with us long,<br>
Miss...?
<SYNC Start=1051550><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1052790><P Class=EGCC>
Marple?<br>
A few days, I think, Miss...?
<SYNC Start=1056230><P Class=EGCC>
Stamfordis. You're down for the<br>
burning, are you?
<SYNC Start=1060070><P Class=EGCC>
The...?<br>
The burning.
<SYNC Start=1062070><P Class=EGCC>
Each year, the village celebrates<br>
the witch trials.
<SYNC Start=1064510><P Class=EGCC>
1664.
<SYNC Start=1066310><P Class=EGCC>
It does tend to draw the crowds.
<SYNC Start=1068750><P Class=EGCC>
Ghouls.
<SYNC Start=1070310><P Class=EGCC>
I can't say I approve, but it helps<br>
keep us afloat.
<SYNC Start=1073430><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1074590><P Class=EGCC>
Thyrza Grey,<br>
proprietrix of The Pale Horse.
<SYNC Start=1078070><P Class=EGCC>
Jane Marple, how do you do?
<SYNC Start=1080190><P Class=EGCC>
Room five, please, Sybil.
<SYNC Start=1082790><P Class=EGCC>
Bella will take your luggage.
<SYNC Start=1084670><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1085750><P Class=EGCC>
(KNOCKS)
<SYNC Start=1087390><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1090630><P Class=EGCC>
Oooh!<br>
Good afternoon, Captain Cottam.
<SYNC Start=1093070><P Class=EGCC>
Afternoon.<br>
Mrs Cottam.
<SYNC Start=1094830><P Class=EGCC>
Settling in comfortably, I hope.<br>
Yes, quite comfortably, thank you.
<SYNC Start=1098230><P Class=EGCC>
Your cleaner, Bella, isn't it?
<SYNC Start=1101030><P Class=EGCC>
Well, she came in yesterday to do<br>
the room.
<SYNC Start=1104190><P Class=EGCC>
Yes?
<SYNC Start=1105430><P Class=EGCC>
Well, we had the "Do not disturb"<br>
sign on the door.
<SYNC Start=1108670><P Class=EGCC>
My husband likes to take a nap<br>
between two and four...
<SYNC Start=1111390><P Class=EGCC>
I'll speak to her about it,<br>
of course.
<SYNC Start=1113350><P Class=EGCC>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=1114950><P Class=EGCC>
See? You only have to ask.
<SYNC Start=1117110><P Class=EGCC>
Captain and Mrs Cottam are local<br>
residents.
<SYNC Start=1119550><P Class=EGCC>
Rather awfully,<br>
they had a fire last week.
<SYNC Start=1122350><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, dear. Yes, I see.
<SYNC Start=1124510><P Class=EGCC>
How unfortunate.<br>
Yes, so they're staying here
<SYNC Start=1127470><P Class=EGCC>
with their housekeeper, Mrs Harsnet,<br>
until their place is repaired.
<SYNC Start=1131750><P Class=EGCC>
We're giving them a rate, of course.
<SYNC Start=1133950><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1142910><P Class=EGCC>
Flight?
<SYNC Start=1144190><P Class=EGCC>
Mr Easterbrook?<br>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=1146990><P Class=EGCC>
Lejeune, sir. Frank Lejeune.
<SYNC Start=1149470><P Class=EGCC>
Six months served in the squadron.<br>
Lejeune!
<SYNC Start=1151990><P Class=EGCC>
Well, I never! Hello, old man.<br>
How are you? Very well, thank you.
<SYNC Start=1156350><P Class=EGCC>
Well, well, well. Good old Frank.
<SYNC Start=1158590><P Class=EGCC>
What are you up to these days?
<SYNC Start=1161030><P Class=EGCC>
I'm a police inspector.<br>
Heavens! There's a thing.
<SYNC Start=1163950><P Class=EGCC>
For my sins.<br>
Well, other people's surely?
<SYNC Start=1166310><P Class=EGCC>
As often as not. I read your<br>
articles now and again.
<SYNC Start=1169990><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, do you?<br>
I enjoy them very much.
<SYNC Start=1171590><P Class=EGCC>
That's good of you to say so.
<SYNC Start=1173750><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1174950><P Class=EGCC>
It's probably too late to say now,<br>
but I was very sorry about your<br>
wife.
<SYNC Start=1179510><P Class=EGCC>
Thanks. That was...
<SYNC Start=1181310><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1182550><P Class=EGCC>
So, what brings you down here?
<SYNC Start=1184870><P Class=EGCC>
Well, I was hoping to have a quick<br>
word with Lady Hesketh-Dubois. She<br>
does live here?
<SYNC Start=1188590><P Class=EGCC>
She did.
<SYNC Start=1190230><P Class=EGCC>
Why? What's all this about?
<SYNC Start=1192430><P Class=EGCC>
Just following a lead.
<SYNC Start=1194590><P Class=EGCC>
Well, I'm sure I can tell you what<br>
you need to know.
<SYNC Start=1197350><P Class=EGCC>
She was my godmother.<br>
Was?
<SYNC Start=1199710><P Class=EGCC>
She died, quite recently.
<SYNC Start=1201550><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1202830><P Class=EGCC>
Is something wrong?
<SYNC Start=1204870><P Class=EGCC>
That's what I'm hoping to find out.
<SYNC Start=1207230><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1210670><P Class=EGCC>
What brings you to Much Deeping,<br>
Miss Marple?
<SYNC Start=1212830><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1214070><P Class=EGCC>
Outside of the burning, I'm afraid<br>
we have very few visitors these<br>
days.
<SYNC Start=1218070><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, really?<br>
It was different in the old days.
<SYNC Start=1221110><P Class=EGCC>
There was a regular clientele,<br>
commercial travellers and the like.
<SYNC Start=1224870><P Class=EGCC>
But since the bypass went through,
<SYNC Start=1228110><P Class=EGCC>
I'm afraid we've become something of<br>
a backwater.
<SYNC Start=1231070><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, indeed? That is a shame.
<SYNC Start=1232990><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1234550><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, how did I...?
<SYNC Start=1236750><P Class=EGCC>
Well, actually, The Pale Horse was a<br>
recommendation.
<SYNC Start=1239990><P Class=EGCC>
Indeed?
<SYNC Start=1241310><P Class=EGCC>
Might I ask from whom?
<SYNC Start=1243590><P Class=EGCC>
You might ask.
<SYNC Start=1245310><P Class=EGCC>
As you wish.
<SYNC Start=1247510><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, no. Please, no, nothing<br>
mysterious at all.
<SYNC Start=1250990><P Class=EGCC>
It's just a friend of a friend.
<SYNC Start=1253430><P Class=EGCC>
I'm afraid when you get to my age,<br>
names...
<SYNC Start=1257030><P Class=EGCC>
Quite hard to place, Miss Grey.
<SYNC Start=1259070><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1260030><P Class=EGCC>
Of course.
<SYNC Start=1261750><P Class=EGCC>
And it's Mrs Grey. At least it was.<br>
He died.
<SYNC Start=1265990><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, I'm very sorry.<br>
Oh, well...
<SYNC Start=1268590><P Class=EGCC>
Now, the first sitting for supper is<br>
usually at 7.30.
<SYNC Start=1271750><P Class=EGCC>
Though, with the burning,
<SYNC Start=1274470><P Class=EGCC>
this evening, we're laying on a<br>
running buffet from seven<br>
in the lounge.
<SYNC Start=1278310><P Class=EGCC>
I see.
<SYNC Start=1279910><P Class=EGCC>
It's tonight, then, is it,<br>
the burning?
<SYNC Start=1282070><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1283270><P Class=EGCC>
It is.
<SYNC Start=1284710><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1289190><P Class=EGCC>
If there's anything else you<br>
require,
<SYNC Start=1291350><P Class=EGCC>
anything at all...
<SYNC Start=1293470><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1294630><P Class=EGCC>
..the telephone will connect you<br>
with reception.
<SYNC Start=1297310><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1299710><P Class=EGCC>
In the meantime, I hope you have a<br>
very pleasant stay.
<SYNC Start=1303390><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, I shall. Thank you. Yes.
<SYNC Start=1305510><P Class=EGCC>
Indeed. Thank you.
<SYNC Start=1307430><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1342110><P Class=EGCC>
Hesketh-Dubois - deceased.
<SYNC Start=1345110><P Class=EGCC>
Seriously, Lejeune, do you really<br>
think this has a bearing on the<br>
death of Father Gorman?
<SYNC Start=1349310><P Class=EGCC>
Possibly.
<SYNC Start=1350990><P Class=EGCC>
Supposing that's the connection?
<SYNC Start=1353990><P Class=EGCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=1355230><P Class=EGCC>
You mean they're all dead?
<SYNC Start=1357110><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1358830><P Class=EGCC>
Hmmm.
<SYNC Start=1359870><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1360910><P Class=EGCC>
Shaw. Harmondsworth. Tuckerton.
<SYNC Start=1364830><P Class=EGCC>
Let us take a few moments to<br>
remember Thomasina Tuckerton.
<SYNC Start=1369070><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1386790><P Class=EGCC>
Mrs Tuckerton!
<SYNC Start=1389070><P Class=EGCC>
Where were you, Mrs Tuckerton?<br>
She needed you.<br>
I tried to track you down.
<SYNC Start=1393230><P Class=EGCC>
Stop it, Ginger! You're not family<br>
and this is none of your business.
<SYNC Start=1396870><P Class=EGCC>
Mrs Tuckerton!
<SYNC Start=1399310><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1408649><P Class=EGCC>
"Oh, Miss Marple,<br>
what can I do for you?"
<SYNC Start=1411249><P Class=EGCC>
I thought it would be useful to your<br>
enquiry
<SYNC Start=1414249><P Class=EGCC>
to know that Lady Hesketh-Dubois, one<br>
of the names on Father Gorman's list,
<SYNC Start=1418609><P Class=EGCC>
died six months ago.
<SYNC Start=1420649><P Class=EGCC>
"Of an inflammation of the brain."
<SYNC Start=1422769><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, you know, then?<br>
"Yes, I know."
<SYNC Start=1425049><P Class=EGCC>
Rather more to the point,<br>
how do YOU?
<SYNC Start=1426809><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, my.
<SYNC Start=1428729><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, I telephoned her house yesterday<br>
and I spoke to a man called Mr<br>
Easterbrook.
<SYNC Start=1433209><P Class=EGCC>
Mark Easterbrook, her godson.
<SYNC Start=1435489><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, you've seen him?<br>
Yes, I've seen him.
<SYNC Start=1437969><P Class=EGCC>
I know him, actually. Well, knew<br>
him.
<SYNC Start=1440369><P Class=EGCC>
He was one of the best.
<SYNC Start=1442569><P Class=EGCC>
Flew Lancs during the war, which is<br>
how we met. I was ground crew.
<SYNC Start=1447169><P Class=EGCC>
"He's a historian now in English<br>
folklore."
<SYNC Start=1449569><P Class=EGCC>
Is he?
<SYNC Start=1451009><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, is he now?
<SYNC Start=1453009><P Class=EGCC>
Miss Marple, I understand that<br>
Father Gorman was a friend.
<SYNC Start=1456089><P Class=EGCC>
But this is a police matter.
<SYNC Start=1458369><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, yes, absolutely.<br>
Absolutely, Inspector.
<SYNC Start=1461769><P Class=EGCC>
It's just...she was a woman of means,<br>
I could imagine.
<SYNC Start=1466249><P Class=EGCC>
Considerable means.<br>
Now, really, I must get on.
<SYNC Start=1469849><P Class=EGCC>
And, please, if there are any<br>
further developments,
<SYNC Start=1473009><P Class=EGCC>
I will let you know.
<SYNC Start=1474929><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1496289><P Class=EGCC>
Sandford, 12th September.
<SYNC Start=1498569><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1502529><P Class=EGCC>
Tuckerton.
<SYNC Start=1504329><P Class=EGCC>
Is there something<br>
I can help you with?
<SYNC Start=1506809><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1508249><P Class=EGCC>
I was just wondering how busy you<br>
were in the spring?
<SYNC Start=1511209><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1513769><P Class=EGCC>
You were thinking<br>
of coming back so soon?
<SYNC Start=1516769><P Class=EGCC>
It is such a lovely spot, even at<br>
this time of year.
<SYNC Start=1520049><P Class=EGCC>
Well, we like it. Yes, have you been<br>
here long, Miss Stamfordis?
<SYNC Start=1523809><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, we've been here seven...
<SYNC Start=1526489><P Class=EGCC>
No, eight years.
<SYNC Start=1529329><P Class=EGCC>
Thyrza and I bought the freehold in<br>
April '47.
<SYNC Start=1532809><P Class=EGCC>
We'd seen it the previous year on a<br>
walking tour.
<SYNC Start=1535769><P Class=EGCC>
Really? Did you? But at the time,<br>
it wasn't for sale.
<SYNC Start=1539129><P Class=EGCC>
Do you think it would be beyond the<br>
realms of possibility that I might<br>
get a drink?
<SYNC Start=1542689><P Class=EGCC>
Is Mrs Grey not in the bar?
<SYNC Start=1544849><P Class=EGCC>
Not unless you've cast an<br>
invisibility spell on her.
<SYNC Start=1547769><P Class=EGCC>
Apologies.
<SYNC Start=1549369><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1561129><P Class=EGCC>
Hello!
<SYNC Start=1562609><P Class=EGCC>
Need some help?
<SYNC Start=1564729><P Class=EGCC>
Is this the way to Much Deeping?<br>
I hope so, Miss...?
<SYNC Start=1567769><P Class=EGCC>
Corrigan. Ginger Corrigan.<br>
Mark Easterbrook.
<SYNC Start=1571169><P Class=EGCC>
I need to get to The Pale Horse.
<SYNC Start=1573409><P Class=EGCC>
Me, too. Would you care for a lift?<br>
Er, yes.
<SYNC Start=1576049><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1593769><P Class=EGCC>
I'm afraid Mr Venables can be<br>
something of a Tartar
<SYNC Start=1596489><P Class=EGCC>
if he doesn't get what he wants<br>
exactly when he wants it.
<SYNC Start=1599569><P Class=EGCC>
I expect it's on account of his...<br>
(WHISPERS) ..polio.
<SYNC Start=1603809><P Class=EGCC>
Something I can get you?
<SYNC Start=1605929><P Class=EGCC>
A blackcurrant cordial would be nice,<br>
thank you.

<SYNC Start=1611889><P Class=EGCC>
Damn it, Cottam, I've warned you<br>
before about your bloody animal.
<SYNC Start=1614969><P Class=EGCC>
Steady on, good dog.
<SYNC Start=1616849><P Class=EGCC>
If I see it around my place again,<br>
I won't be responsible...
<SYNC Start=1619809><P Class=EGCC>
Like you wouldn't be responsible for<br>
the fire at my house? What?
<SYNC Start=1622649><P Class=EGCC>
I'm not going to sell, no matter<br>
what tricks you get up to.
<SYNC Start=1625529><P Class=EGCC>
What are you talking about?<br>
You might have money, Venables.
<SYNC Start=1628929><P Class=EGCC>
And good luck to you. But it doesn't<br>
mean you can have what you want.
<SYNC Start=1632089><P Class=EGCC>
All I'm saying is, I wish you'd keep<br>
your bloody dog under control.<br>
The bitch is a menace.
<SYNC Start=1636449><P Class=EGCC>
I know you've had a few, but watch<br>
your language in front of my wife.
<SYNC Start=1639529><P Class=EGCC>
My apologies.<br>
Right.
<SYNC Start=1641369><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1644929><P Class=EGCC>
Mrs Harsnet not joining you for a<br>
constitutional today?
<SYNC Start=1648449><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1655609><P Class=EGCC>
Sorry, never a dull moment.
<SYNC Start=1657689><P Class=EGCC>
Oh...
<SYNC Start=1659409><P Class=EGCC>
You were going to tell me about how<br>
you and Mrs Grey came to The Pale<br>
Horse.
<SYNC Start=1663129><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1664369><P Class=EGCC>
It was a bad winter.
<SYNC Start=1666569><P Class=EGCC>
The village had been cut off by<br>
snow.
<SYNC Start=1668969><P Class=EGCC>
And the landlord's wife...<br>
Yes?
<SYNC Start=1671609><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1675209><P Class=EGCC>
He'd been called to Market Basing,<br>
you see,<br>
the landlord.
<SYNC Start=1677969><P Class=EGCC>
Had he? Yes, I see.
<SYNC Start=1679889><P Class=EGCC>
Found her at the bottom of the<br>
stairs. A fall, they said.
<SYNC Start=1684129><P Class=EGCC>
But I should think it was the cold<br>
that did for her in the end.
<SYNC Start=1687449><P Class=EGCC>
How terrible.<br>
All that time in the dark.
<SYNC Start=1691049><P Class=EGCC>
And the pain.
<SYNC Start=1693129><P Class=EGCC>
Well, a broken pelvis.
<SYNC Start=1695689><P Class=EGCC>
You can imagine.
<SYNC Start=1697529><P Class=EGCC>
The cold seeping into her.
<SYNC Start=1699689><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1701089><P Class=EGCC>
Come the thaw, he put the place on<br>
the market.
<SYNC Start=1703289><P Class=EGCC>
And here you are.<br>
Yes.

Ah, Miss Marple. You well?<br>
Yes, very well, thank you.
<SYNC Start=1732729><P Class=EGCC>
It really is the most extraordinary<br>

<SYNC Start=1735329><P Class=EGCC>
Did you find what you were looking<br>
for? No, no, nothing yet.
<SYNC Start=1738529><P Class=EGCC>

I'd very much like you to see.

Yes, it is.
<SYNC Start=1767249><P Class=EGCC>
Quite something. Mr...?

<SYNC Start=1772489><P Class=EGCC>
How do you do? May I introduce Miss<br>

It's my first time in Much Deeping.<br>

<SYNC Start=1778529><P Class=EGCC>
Rupert Cottam. How do you do?<br>
My wife, Kanga.
<SYNC Start=1781289><P Class=EGCC>
My housekeeper, Lydia Harsnet.<br>
How do you do?
<SYNC Start=1784009><P Class=EGCC>
You live here or are you down<br>
for the burning?
<SYNC Start=1786089><P Class=EGCC>
Locals, albeit displaced ones.
<SYNC Start=1788209><P Class=EGCC>
We had a fire last week, so we're<br>
billeted at the inn.
<SYNC Start=1790529><P Class=EGCC>
Poor you. How bloody.

Mr Easterbrook.
<SYNC Start=1810209><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, I'm a historian.
<SYNC Start=1813129><P Class=EGCC>
I'm down here researching the<br>
witchcraft, Wincanton, and so forth.
<SYNC Start=1817569><P Class=EGCC>
Have you anything to say?<br>
I'm innocent.
<SYNC Start=1820609><P Class=EGCC>
And we say to you...
<SYNC Start=1822449><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1823569><P Class=EGCC>
Guilty!

(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
<SYNC Start=1827689><P Class=EGCC>
(LAUGHTER)
<SYNC Start=1829569><P Class=EGCC>
There's a brass in the church you<br>
might care to see, Mr Easterbrook.
<SYNC Start=1832889><P Class=EGCC>
Paid for by the villagers in<br>
remembrance of Goody Carne.
<SYNC Start=1836409><P Class=EGCC>
Mrs Harsnet's late husband was vicar<br>
of our little parish. Made a study<br>
of it all.
<SYNC Start=1840529><P Class=EGCC>
GINGER: Who's Goody Carne?<br>
Well, it's Goody Carne
<SYNC Start=1843489><P Class=EGCC>
whose memory the villagers are<br>
honouring tonight.
<SYNC Start=1846129><P Class=EGCC>
The witch?<br>
She was accused by the squire
<SYNC Start=1849569><P Class=EGCC>
of having unnatural traffic with the<br>
Devil.
<SYNC Start=1852169><P Class=EGCC>
She was. Although, in truth,
<SYNC Start=1854849><P Class=EGCC>
I think the squire was really after<br>
her land.
<SYNC Start=1857049><P Class=EGCC>
She was tried, found guilty, and<br>
hanged.
<SYNC Start=1860329><P Class=EGCC>
From the old willow tree over there.
<SYNC Start=1863689><P Class=EGCC>
Burnt at the stake, surely?
<SYNC Start=1865889><P Class=EGCC>
COTTAM: Actually, the vast majority<br>
of witches were hanged.
<SYNC Start=1869089><P Class=EGCC>
And it wasn't the clean drop used<br>
nowadays, I can tell you.
<SYNC Start=1871769><P Class=EGCC>
Ru, must you? Don't know if you've<br>
ever seen anyone being throttled?
<SYNC Start=1875889><P Class=EGCC>
Might be about to. Not a pretty<br>
sight, is all I was going to say.
<SYNC Start=1879449><P Class=EGCC>
Cripes.<br>
Well, people still say
<SYNC Start=1881849><P Class=EGCC>
that good, old Goody is making her<br>
way home
<SYNC Start=1885089><P Class=EGCC>
at a cock's stride.
<SYNC Start=1887129><P Class=EGCC>
And that when she reaches the farm,
<SYNC Start=1889369><P Class=EGCC>
the whole village will go up in<br>
flames.
<SYNC Start=1892329><P Class=EGCC>
(CHEERING)
<SYNC Start=1894209><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1899689><P Class=EGCC>
To be honest, I've seen enough fire<br>
in the last two weeks to last me a<br>
lifetime.
<SYNC Start=1904009><P Class=EGCC>
If it's all the same to you, I'd<br>
like to go inside before I do<br>
something I regret.

(HUSHED CONVERSATION)
<SYNC Start=1927209><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;

Good night!<br>
Oh, good night.
<SYNC Start=1932009><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1933889><P Class=EGCC>
Miss Grey, I remember now who it was<br>
who recommended The Pale Horse.
<SYNC Start=1937929><P Class=EGCC>
A Miss Tuckerton, could it be?
<SYNC Start=1940289><P Class=EGCC>
Mrs Tuckerton?
<SYNC Start=1942449><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, yes, I'm sure that's what the<br>
name was.
<SYNC Start=1944849><P Class=EGCC>
Ah.<br>
Well, good night, then.
<SYNC Start=1947209><P Class=EGCC>
Good night.
<SYNC Start=1948689><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, Miss Marple!
<SYNC Start=1950609><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1951729><P Class=EGCC>
I wonder, I'm due to call on Roger<br>
Venables tomorrow for lunch.
<SYNC Start=1955649><P Class=EGCC>
Perhaps you'd like to join me?<br>
Oh, Mr Venables.
<SYNC Start=1958369><P Class=EGCC>
You'd be doing me a favour. He can<br>
be a crusty old devil.
<SYNC Start=1961129><P Class=EGCC>
But my husband was fond of him and<br>
I'm trying to carry on his good<br>
work,
<SYNC Start=1964889><P Class=EGCC>
make him part of our little<br>
community, as it were.
<SYNC Start=1967289><P Class=EGCC>
In that case, yes, of course, I'd be<br>
delighted. Hurrah!
<SYNC Start=1970209><P Class=EGCC>
I'd be grateful if you didn't<br>
mention it to Ru...
<SYNC Start=1972769><P Class=EGCC>
Captain and Mrs Cottam.
<SYNC Start=1974929><P Class=EGCC>
they don't really get on<br>
with Mr Venables. So I gathered.
<SYNC Start=1977689><P Class=EGCC>
They wouldn't like it if they<br>
thought I'd been fraternising.
<SYNC Start=1980649><P Class=EGCC>
Of course, of course.<br>
Good night, then.
<SYNC Start=1983449><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;

(COCK CROWS)
<SYNC Start=2024769><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2038249><P Class=EGCC>
Good morning, Mrs Grey.<br>
Ah!
<SYNC Start=2040129><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2042049><P Class=EGCC>
I think perhaps you have some gift<br>
for clairvoyance.
<SYNC Start=2045529><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, nothing so exotic, I'm afraid.
<SYNC Start=2048569><P Class=EGCC>
Just a keen sense of smell.
<SYNC Start=2050769><P Class=EGCC>
Well, unless I'm much mistaken,<br>
that's Eau de Lys you're wearing?
<SYNC Start=2054729><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2059369><P Class=EGCC>
I hope you'll forgive me,
<SYNC Start=2061529><P Class=EGCC>
but I had the idea -<br>
Bella had it, too -
<SYNC Start=2064129><P Class=EGCC>
that you might need us?
<SYNC Start=2066489><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2067889><P Class=EGCC>
Need you, Mrs Grey?
<SYNC Start=2070209><P Class=EGCC>
Sybil thinks you came here<br>
to find us.
<SYNC Start=2073209><P Class=EGCC>
She's seldom at fault.
<SYNC Start=2075289><P Class=EGCC>
Why would I want to find you?
<SYNC Start=2077969><P Class=EGCC>
That I do not know, yet.
<SYNC Start=2080409><P Class=EGCC>
But I shall.
<SYNC Start=2082609><P Class=EGCC>
Rely on it.
<SYNC Start=2084489><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2094289><P Class=EGCC>
Paul?
<SYNC Start=2095529><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2107809><P Class=EGCC>
Last night, at the burning,
<SYNC Start=2110009><P Class=EGCC>
you're sure it was him?
<SYNC Start=2112049><P Class=EGCC>
Mr Venables?
<SYNC Start=2114249><P Class=EGCC>
Yeah, though God knows what he's<br>
done to himself since.
<SYNC Start=2117289><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, the wheelchair.
<SYNC Start=2119289><P Class=EGCC>
From what I can gather,
<SYNC Start=2121529><P Class=EGCC>
he's been unable to walk for some<br>
years.
<SYNC Start=2124129><P Class=EGCC>
Really?
<SYNC Start=2125409><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2126329><P Class=EGCC>
You're sure?
<SYNC Start=2128209><P Class=EGCC>
I could have sworn that was the man<br>
I saw.
<SYNC Start=2130449><P Class=EGCC>
Could you have been mistaken,<br>
perhaps?
<SYNC Start=2132809><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2134729><P Class=EGCC>
I could have. It's possible.
<SYNC Start=2136889><P Class=EGCC>
Unless he has a twin brother.
<SYNC Start=2140409><P Class=EGCC>
In fiction, perhaps. But in real<br>
life, it doesn't happen.
<SYNC Start=2143449><P Class=EGCC>
It really doesn't.<br>
No.
<SYNC Start=2145609><P Class=EGCC>
I expect not.
<SYNC Start=2147489><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2148649><P Class=EGCC>
I'm sorry. I can't help but feel<br>
like I've wasted your time.
<SYNC Start=2152249><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, no, please, don't think that.<br>
Not at all.
<SYNC Start=2154849><P Class=EGCC>
Your Father Gorman,
<SYNC Start=2157609><P Class=EGCC>
someone should answer for him.
<SYNC Start=2159649><P Class=EGCC>
They will.
<SYNC Start=2163089><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2165175><P Class=EGCC>
And I think it's possible that<br>
Mrs Davis may have visited The Pale<br>
Horse.
<SYNC Start=2169215><P Class=EGCC>
"And what makes you think that?"
<SYNC Start=2171535><P Class=EGCC>
I found a list of names which match<br>
those sent to me by Father Gorman
<SYNC Start=2175615><P Class=EGCC>
concealed in one of Mrs Davis's<br>
shoes, of all places.
<SYNC Start=2179735><P Class=EGCC>
Miss Marple, that's evidence!
<SYNC Start=2181775><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, it is, inspector.
<SYNC Start=2183975><P Class=EGCC>
But, more importantly, that list was<br>
written on headed notepaper
<SYNC Start=2188495><P Class=EGCC>
from the Pale Horse.
<SYNC Start=2190495><P Class=EGCC>
Please, don't tell me you've taken<br>
it upon yourself to go down there?
<SYNC Start=2194455><P Class=EGCC>
I'm afraid that would be an untruth.
<SYNC Start=2196895><P Class=EGCC>
But you see, the names on Mrs Davis's<br>
list have dates beside them
<SYNC Start=2201335><P Class=EGCC>
which match certain entries in the<br>
hotel register.
<SYNC Start=2204655><P Class=EGCC>
Do they? Well, I certainly think<br>
you might be onto something.
<SYNC Start=2208655><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, do you think so? I do.<br>
But, please, do nothing further.
<SYNC Start=2212895><P Class=EGCC>
I'm sorry, Inspector,<br>
it's a very bad line.
<SYNC Start=2215055><P Class=EGCC>
I didn't quite catch that.
<SYNC Start=2217215><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, there go the pips. I haven't any<br>
more money to put in.
<SYNC Start=2220335><P Class=EGCC>
Miss Marple...
<SYNC Start=2221495><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2225135><P Class=EGCC>
(DOG WHINES)<br>
Good morning.
<SYNC Start=2227175><P Class=EGCC>
The vet's just gone. Ring worm.
<SYNC Start=2229455><P Class=EGCC>
Frightfully catching. Don't want the<br>
other dogs getting it. Oh, no.
<SYNC Start=2232655><P Class=EGCC>
Or yourself.
<SYNC Start=2234375><P Class=EGCC>
This stuff makes their fur fall out,<br>
leaves a bare patch.
<SYNC Start=2237215><P Class=EGCC>
But it'll soon grow back. Won't it,<br>
old dog?
<SYNC Start=2239935><P Class=EGCC>
Ready for the off?<br>
Oh, yes! Yes. Yes, indeed.
<SYNC Start=2242575><P Class=EGCC>
I'm going to show Miss Marple round<br>
the church. Very nice, too.
<SYNC Start=2245575><P Class=EGCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=2246655><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2249135><P Class=EGCC>
Have you worked long for Captain<br>
Cottam?
<SYNC Start=2251735><P Class=EGCC>
Two years, nearly.<br>
After my husband died,
<SYNC Start=2254735><P Class=EGCC>
they were kind enough to offer me a<br>
position.
<SYNC Start=2257255><P Class=EGCC>
Your husband was vicar here,<br>
I understand?
<SYNC Start=2260295><P Class=EGCC>
Yes. Yes, he was.
<SYNC Start=2262095><P Class=EGCC>
Philip had been a missionary in West<br>
Africa.
<SYNC Start=2264375><P Class=EGCC>
Malaria. Weakened his heart, I<br>
think. Over the years.
<SYNC Start=2268175><P Class=EGCC>
Last attack,<br>
wasn't strong enough to...
<SYNC Start=2270495><P Class=EGCC>
No. I am sorry.
<SYNC Start=2272775><P Class=EGCC>
I hope you don't mind, but I asked<br>
Miss Corrigan to join us.
<SYNC Start=2275375><P Class=EGCC>
No, not at all. Good morning, Miss<br>
Corrigan.
<SYNC Start=2277455><P Class=EGCC>
Do call me Ginger. Everyone does.
<SYNC Start=2279455><P Class=EGCC>
Good Lord, Mr Venables must be<br>
rolling in money.
<SYNC Start=2282815><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, and no-one really knows where<br>
it came from.
<SYNC Start=2285215><P Class=EGCC>
He's quite the mystery man.<br>
Travelled the world, you know.
<SYNC Start=2288135><P Class=EGCC>
So it seems a supreme irony
<SYNC Start=2290855><P Class=EGCC>
that I should have emerged unscathed
<SYNC Start=2293055><P Class=EGCC>
from some of the most disease-ridden<br>
corners of the globe
<SYNC Start=2296375><P Class=EGCC>
only to contract polio in my own<br>
rather dull little country.
<SYNC Start=2301655><P Class=EGCC>
Eastbourne Lido.
<SYNC Start=2303935><P Class=EGCC>
1949.
<SYNC Start=2305895><P Class=EGCC>
God rot the place and all who live<br>
there.
<SYNC Start=2308295><P Class=EGCC>
Tell me, Mr Venables,
<SYNC Start=2310375><P Class=EGCC>
why did you come to live in Much<br>
Deeping, so far away from everything?
<SYNC Start=2314375><P Class=EGCC>
Do you have friends here?<br>
No.
<SYNC Start=2316895><P Class=EGCC>
I came to this part of the world<br>
precisely because I knew no-one<br>
here.
<SYNC Start=2320215><P Class=EGCC>
Did you? Yes, well, I see.
<SYNC Start=2322255><P Class=EGCC>
Yet, for all that, I find I'm now on<br>
the tourist trail.
<SYNC Start=2325895><P Class=EGCC>
A site of historic local interest.
<SYNC Start=2329135><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2330295><P Class=EGCC>
Along with the burning, and those<br>
monsters up at The Pale Horse.
<SYNC Start=2334135><P Class=EGCC>
Monsters, Mr Venables?
<SYNC Start=2336015><P Class=EGCC>
You know what they say, two's<br>
company, three's a coven.
<SYNC Start=2338975><P Class=EGCC>
Seems a little harsh.
<SYNC Start=2341175><P Class=EGCC>
I know this summer finds them<br>
useful, Mrs Harsnet,
<SYNC Start=2343735><P Class=EGCC>
but in my opinion, they should be<br>
driven out,
<SYNC Start=2347255><P Class=EGCC>

if needs be.
<SYNC Start=2350575><P Class=EGCC>
What they're up to in that place...
<SYNC Start=2352895><P Class=EGCC>
What are they up to?
<SYNC Start=2354935><P Class=EGCC>
Wickedness.
<SYNC Start=2356975><P Class=EGCC>
All manner of black devilry.
<SYNC Start=2358935><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2360335><P Class=EGCC>
Of course, I was brought up with the<br>
Devil.
<SYNC Start=2362495><P Class=EGCC>
Believing in him, I mean.
<SYNC Start=2364615><P Class=EGCC>
He always did seem to me so silly.
<SYNC Start=2366935><P Class=EGCC>
With hooves and a tail,
<SYNC Start=2369095><P Class=EGCC>
capering about like a ham actor.
<SYNC Start=2371175><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2372375><P Class=EGCC>
Call me old-fashioned, but I really<br>
can't go along with this modern<br>
playing-down of evil
<SYNC Start=2377255><P Class=EGCC>
as something that doesn't really<br>
exist.
<SYNC Start=2379535><P Class=EGCC>
Would you agree, Miss Marple?<br>
Yes. Yes, indeed I do.
<SYNC Start=2383455><P Class=EGCC>
Evil is powerful, sometimes more<br>
powerful than good.
<SYNC Start=2386975><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2388175><P Class=EGCC>
It's there. It needs to be<br>
recognised...and fought.
<SYNC Start=2392895><P Class=EGCC>
Fought, Miss Marple?<br>
Otherwise we go down to darkness.
<SYNC Start=2397695><P Class=EGCC>
Last night, Miss Marple, did I hear<br>
you right?
<SYNC Start=2400455><P Class=EGCC>
What's that? You told Mrs Grey<br>
you knew Mrs Tuckerton.
<SYNC Start=2404135><P Class=EGCC>
Wouldn't be Amelia Tuckerton?
<SYNC Start=2406015><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2407055><P Class=EGCC>
Stepdaughter by the name of<br>
Thomasina.
<SYNC Start=2409415><P Class=EGCC>
Possibly. As I say, she's just a<br>
friend of a friend. Why?
<SYNC Start=2414135><P Class=EGCC>
I worked with a girl at the gallery<br>
called Thomasina Tuckerton.
<SYNC Start=2416975><P Class=EGCC>
"Tommy Tucker" we called her.
<SYNC Start=2419015><P Class=EGCC>
Well, it might be, it might be.<br>
You must ask her.
<SYNC Start=2422135><P Class=EGCC>
That's impossible, I'm afraid.
<SYNC Start=2424375><P Class=EGCC>
Tommy died two weeks ago.
<SYNC Start=2426255><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2427735><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, I'm sorry.
<SYNC Start=2430175><P Class=EGCC>
'And only a few weeks before, she'd<br>
been so happy.
<SYNC Start=2433135><P Class=EGCC>
John had asked her to marry him.
<SYNC Start=2435295><P Class=EGCC>
And she'd accepted him. Yes, I see.
<SYNC Start=2438335><P Class=EGCC>
We thought it must be some sort of<br>
nervous alopecia.
<SYNC Start=2441375><P Class=EGCC>
But she just got weaker.<br>
What did the doctors diagnose?
<SYNC Start=2444295><P Class=EGCC>
They didn't know. She was just so...
<SYNC Start=2447015><P Class=EGCC>
alone.
<SYNC Start=2448455><P Class=EGCC>
(GASPS)
<SYNC Start=2450375><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2452935><P Class=EGCC>
Her stepmother was on a cruise, so<br>
there was only me and John to look<br>
after her.
<SYNC Start=2457175><P Class=EGCC>
Then, in the end,
<SYNC Start=2459575><P Class=EGCC>
only me.
<SYNC Start=2461175><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2462175><P Class=EGCC>
She didn't want John<br>
to see her like that.
<SYNC Start=2464215><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2466735><P Class=EGCC>
Where was her father? He died himself<br>
less than a year ago,
<SYNC Start=2470215><P Class=EGCC>
not long after Tommy's 19th.
<SYNC Start=2472255><P Class=EGCC>
I finally ran her stepmother to<br>
ground in Rio.
<SYNC Start=2474935><P Class=EGCC>
It was all I could do to persuade<br>
her to come back for the funeral.
<SYNC Start=2477775><P Class=EGCC>
There was bad blood between them?
<SYNC Start=2479815><P Class=EGCC>
She said John was<br>
only after Tommy's money. Ah.
<SYNC Start=2482535><P Class=EGCC>
She was a wealthy girl?<br>
She would have been.
<SYNC Start=2485215><P Class=EGCC>
Her father left her a fortune to be<br>
held in trust
<SYNC Start=2488295><P Class=EGCC>
until Tommy was 21 or...
<SYNC Start=2490575><P Class=EGCC>
Or until she married. Yes, that is so<br>
often the way.
<SYNC Start=2494255><P Class=EGCC>
It goes now, I suppose, to the<br>
stepmother? Yes.
<SYNC Start=2497695><P Class=EGCC>
Yes. That, too, is so often the way.
<SYNC Start=2500935><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2502135><P Class=EGCC>
There you are. I was wondering where<br>
you'd gotten to.
<SYNC Start=2504615><P Class=EGCC>
Why? What's to do? Mrs Grey is<br>
showing Mr Easterbrook her books.
<SYNC Start=2509015><P Class=EGCC>
As a consequence, we've been invited<br>
to tea in her sanctum sanctorum.
<SYNC Start=2513415><P Class=EGCC>
Apparently, it's in the old<br>
courthouse where Goody Carne was<br>
tried. Come on.

<SYNC Start=2568215><P Class=EGCC>
Mrs Grey, you really do have some<br>

<SYNC Start=2571815><P Class=EGCC>
An original Maleus Maleficarum
<SYNC Start=2574455><P Class=EGCC>
and this, Grimoire's Saducismus<br>

<SYNC Start=2577455><P Class=EGCC>
Very rare indeed.

Oh, it's so nice to meet someone who<br>

<SYNC Start=2582735><P Class=EGCC>
MRS COTTAM: This is where you do<br>

<SYNC Start=2585095><P Class=EGCC>
MRS GREY: Ah, that plain and<br>
forthright voice
<SYNC Start=2587535><P Class=EGCC>
for which the Antipodes is so<br>
rightly renowned!
<SYNC Start=2589615><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2590655><P Class=EGCC>
You're well informed, Mrs Cottam.<br>
Someone must have been talking.
<SYNC Start=2594535><P Class=EGCC>
In a village, I find everyone knows<br>
one's business far better than one<br>
does oneself.
<SYNC Start=2599215><P Class=EGCC>
I'm sure the three of us enjoy<br>
a splendid sinister reputation.
<SYNC Start=2603895><P Class=EGCC>
Got all you want? Yes, thank you,<br>
Bella. That'll be all.
<SYNC Start=2607575><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2610615><P Class=EGCC>
Give it here!
<SYNC Start=2612535><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2613455><P Class=EGCC>
I'm sure someone will have told you<br>
Bella is the local witch.
<SYNC Start=2617335><P Class=EGCC>
Really?<br>
Yes, she has certain powers,
<SYNC Start=2620535><P Class=EGCC>
though not as great as those that<br>
Sybil enjoys.
<SYNC Start=2623855><P Class=EGCC>
I have always been attracted to the<br>
occult.
<SYNC Start=2626415><P Class=EGCC>
Even as a child, I realised I had<br>
unusual powers.
<SYNC Start=2630855><P Class=EGCC>
Did you? Really?
<SYNC Start=2632615><P Class=EGCC>
Automatic writing came quite<br>
naturally to me.
<SYNC Start=2635495><P Class=EGCC>
I didn't even know what it was.
<SYNC Start=2637775><P Class=EGCC>
I'd just sit there with a pencil in<br>
my hand, without a clue what was<br>
happening.
<SYNC Start=2642055><P Class=EGCC>
Automatic writing.
<SYNC Start=2644255><P Class=EGCC>
The difference between that<br>
and mindless scribbling is...?
<SYNC Start=2648415><P Class=EGCC>
Interpretation.<br>
Ah, yes.
<SYNC Start=2650495><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, of course. You don't believe any<br>
of this, do you, Miss Marple?
<SYNC Start=2654215><P Class=EGCC>
But you do, don't you?<br>
I don't believe, Miss Marple.
<SYNC Start=2657055><P Class=EGCC>
I know!
<SYNC Start=2659015><P Class=EGCC>
Why else have people come through<br>

And the witch doctor?

to risk damnation.

<SYNC Start=2672335><P Class=EGCC>
and the cup of death.<br>
Ah.
<SYNC Start=2674215><P Class=EGCC>
So simple, isn't it, love and death?
<SYNC Start=2676415><P Class=EGCC>
The love potion...<br>
to win the man you want.
<SYNC Start=2679695><P Class=EGCC>

<SYNC Start=2687975><P Class=EGCC>
The truth, of course...
<SYNC Start=2690015><P Class=EGCC>
The aphrodisiac in the draught.
<SYNC Start=2692055><P Class=EGCC>
And the cup of death?
<SYNC Start=2694135><P Class=EGCC>
Untraceable poisons perhaps?
<SYNC Start=2696615><P Class=EGCC>
Poisons? Childish stuff.
<SYNC Start=2698735><P Class=EGCC>
There are new horizons, Miss Marple.
<SYNC Start=2700815><P Class=EGCC>
The mind.
<SYNC Start=2702695><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2703935><P Class=EGCC>
Knowledge of what it can do<br>
and what it can be made to do.
<SYNC Start=2706735><P Class=EGCC>
Made to do?
<SYNC Start=2708735><P Class=EGCC>
Influence your subject to commit<br>
suicide, is that it? No.
<SYNC Start=2711975><P Class=EGCC>
The psychologists<br>
have shown us the way.
<SYNC Start=2714255><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2715415><P Class=EGCC>
The desire for death.
<SYNC Start=2717455><P Class=EGCC>
It's there in everyone.
<SYNC Start=2719495><P Class=EGCC>
And that desire can be stimulated.

<SYNC Start=2786575><P Class=EGCC>
Oh!
<SYNC Start=2788495><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;

Captain Cottam had already retired.
<SYNC Start=2792615><P Class=EGCC>
It was his custom to take a siesta<br>
at that time of the afternoon.
<SYNC Start=2796575><P Class=EGCC>

<SYNC Start=2799295><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2800375><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, around then.
<SYNC Start=2802455><P Class=EGCC>
And...
<SYNC Start=2804455><P Class=EGCC>
that's when I found him.
<SYNC Start=2806415><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2811295><P Class=EGCC>
Rupert was in the garden<br>
with the dog.

That was the last I saw him.
<SYNC Start=2816855><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;

Oh, just bad old curiosity.
<SYNC Start=2873575><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2876895><P Class=EGCC>
I'm not sure...<br>

I've asked the local pathologist to<br>

Cottam died of natural causes.
<SYNC Start=2913255><P Class=EGCC>
Natural causes?<br>
His heart.
<SYNC Start=2915335><P Class=EGCC>
It would appear he'd been...<br>
exerting himself.
<SYNC Start=2919175><P Class=EGCC>
After a fashion.
<SYNC Start=2921375><P Class=EGCC>
I understood he'd gone for an<br>
afternoon nap.
<SYNC Start=2923495><P Class=EGCC>
It's possible he may not have been<br>
having 40 winks by himself.
<SYNC Start=2926775><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, I see.
<SYNC Start=2928655><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2930335><P Class=EGCC>
I must say, I thought there was<br>
rather more
<SYNC Start=2932775><P Class=EGCC>
to their arrangements<br>
than simple housekeeping.
<SYNC Start=2935655><P Class=EGCC>
And Mrs Cottam party to it,<br>
would you think?
<SYNC Start=2939535><P Class=EGCC>
I would think so, wouldn't you?
<SYNC Start=2941655><P Class=EGCC>
It goes on. You only<br>
have to read the Sunday papers.
<SYNC Start=2944575><P Class=EGCC>

there's anything sinister about it.

is...

<SYNC Start=3012015><P Class=EGCC>
Local police tried to pin it on<br>
Mark, of course.
<SYNC Start=3014535><P Class=EGCC>
Jealousy, but it didn't stick.
<SYNC Start=3016975><P Class=EGCC>
Anything in it?
<SYNC Start=3018975><P Class=EGCC>
I'd have sworn not, but...
<SYNC Start=3020855><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3022295><P Class=EGCC>
(SIGHS)<br>
Given the right circumstances,
<SYNC Start=3025255><P Class=EGCC>
who knows what a chap might do?
<SYNC Start=3028215><P Class=EGCC>
Tell me, Inspector, have you ever<br>
heard of
<SYNC Start=3030535><P Class=EGCC>
a physician called Sir William<br>
Dougdale of Harley Street?
<SYNC Start=3033855><P Class=EGCC>
He's a nerve doctor, isn't he?<br>
So I believe.
<SYNC Start=3036415><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, we use him sometimes if one of<br>
our men
<SYNC Start=3038695><P Class=EGCC>
goes down with a bad case of the<br>
jitters. Why, what about him?
<SYNC Start=3042055><P Class=EGCC>
Perhaps you might like to ask him<br>
about one of his patients?
<SYNC Start=3045295><P Class=EGCC>
Name of Venables.
<SYNC Start=3047335><P Class=EGCC>
Price Court.
<SYNC Start=3049335><P Class=EGCC>
Much Deeping.
<SYNC Start=3051535><P Class=EGCC>
Bye, Miss Marple.<br>
Goodbye.
<SYNC Start=3054095><P Class=EGCC>
Miss Marple.
<SYNC Start=3056295><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, Miss Corrigan.<br>
You said evil had to be fought.
<SYNC Start=3059095><P Class=EGCC>
Otherwise we go down to darkness.<br>
Did you mean it?
<SYNC Start=3062135><P Class=EGCC>
Every word.
<SYNC Start=3064295><P Class=EGCC>
Is there something you'd like to tell<br>
me perhaps?
<SYNC Start=3067415><P Class=EGCC>
Yes.<br>
About your friend, is it?
<SYNC Start=3069375><P Class=EGCC>
Tommy Tuckerton?
<SYNC Start=3071495><P Class=EGCC>
You're worried that her death was<br>
perhaps not entirely a natural one?
<SYNC Start=3075335><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3080295><P Class=EGCC>
C R Bradley.
<SYNC Start=3082495><P Class=EGCC>
I found it at Tommy Tuckerton's<br>
house. Her stepmother had it.
<SYNC Start=3085975><P Class=EGCC>
That's what led me here.<br>
Charing Cross, 6502.
<SYNC Start=3088495><P Class=EGCC>
Have you tried to contact Mr Bradley?
<SYNC Start=3091575><P Class=EGCC>
I'm ashamed to say I was afraid to<br>
on my own.
<SYNC Start=3094015><P Class=EGCC>
Well, there's two of us now.<br>
Two of us?
<SYNC Start=3096615><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, you see, I too lost a friend.
<SYNC Start=3099615><P Class=EGCC>
A very dear friend.<br>
His name was Father Gorman.
<SYNC Start=3102695><P Class=EGCC>
And somehow, the Pale Horse,
<SYNC Start=3105175><P Class=EGCC>
perhaps with the help of Mr Bradley,<br>
was at the heart of it.
<SYNC Start=3108975><P Class=EGCC>
And now with Captain Cottam's<br>
murder...
<SYNC Start=3112455><P Class=EGCC>
Murder? I thought a heart seizure.
<SYNC Start=3114415><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, no, my dear.
<SYNC Start=3116655><P Class=EGCC>
He was murdered, I'm quite sure of<br>
it.
<SYNC Start=3118575><P Class=EGCC>
But why and by whom...?
<SYNC Start=3121335><P Class=EGCC>
We'll get to the bottom of it.<br>
I know we will.
<SYNC Start=3123695><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, yes, but we must beware.
<SYNC Start=3126695><P Class=EGCC>
For even while we are hunting him...
<SYNC Start=3129375><P Class=EGCC>
I fear he may well be hunting us.
<SYNC Start=3132375><P Class=EGCC>
Please be careful, Miss Marple.
<SYNC Start=3134575><P Class=EGCC>
Don't worry.<br>
I'll be back from London tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=3137135><P Class=EGCC>
See you then.
<SYNC Start=3139055><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3154674><P Class=EGCC>
Well, dear lady,
<SYNC Start=3156754><P Class=EGCC>
how may one be of service?
<SYNC Start=3158794><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, no, thank you.
<SYNC Start=3161394><P Class=EGCC>
Well, I'm not sure how this is meant<br>
to work, Mr Bradley.
<SYNC Start=3166594><P Class=EGCC>
I suppose the first thing to ask<br>
is...
<SYNC Start=3168594><P Class=EGCC>
how much?
<SYNC Start=3170794><P Class=EGCC>
That's not how we go about things,<br>
dear me, no.
<SYNC Start=3175594><P Class=EGCC>
We haven't introduced ourselves yet,<br>
have we?
<SYNC Start=3178434><P Class=EGCC>
I don't think<br>
I ought to give you my name.
<SYNC Start=3180594><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, cautious, yes, I like that.
<SYNC Start=3182634><P Class=EGCC>
Admirable quality, but...
<SYNC Start=3184514><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3185754><P Class=EGCC>
I think we may allow ourselves<br>
a moment's candour.
<SYNC Start=3189674><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3191714><P Class=EGCC>
Who is it sent you to me?
<SYNC Start=3193874><P Class=EGCC>
Let's just say a friend of mine has a<br>
friend who has a friend.
<SYNC Start=3197714><P Class=EGCC>
Quite.
<SYNC Start=3199594><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3200514><P Class=EGCC>
You know my calling, I presume?
<SYNC Start=3202954><P Class=EGCC>
Turf commission agent?
<SYNC Start=3204834><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3205954><P Class=EGCC>
Interested in horses?
<SYNC Start=3208074><P Class=EGCC>
Betting?
<SYNC Start=3210194><P Class=EGCC>
Any particular horse<br>
you had in mind?
<SYNC Start=3212794><P Class=EGCC>
A pale horse.
<SYNC Start=3214754><P Class=EGCC>
Very good, very good.
<SYNC Start=3216874><P Class=EGCC>
Excellent.
<SYNC Start=3218754><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3219874><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, you yourself, if I may say so...
<SYNC Start=3222314><P Class=EGCC>
seem to be rather a dark horse.
<SYNC Start=3224354><P Class=EGCC>
(LAUGHS)
<SYNC Start=3226514><P Class=EGCC>
Let me assure you that there's no<br>
need for any anxiety.
<SYNC Start=3229474><P Class=EGCC>
I'm a lawyer myself.
<SYNC Start=3231594><P Class=EGCC>
Disbarred, I understand.
<SYNC Start=3233554><P Class=EGCC>
Unfairly, of course.
<SYNC Start=3235674><P Class=EGCC>
Just so.
<SYNC Start=3237634><P Class=EGCC>
But disbarred or not,
<SYNC Start=3239754><P Class=EGCC>
I do know my law.
<SYNC Start=3241874><P Class=EGCC>
And everything I recommend here<br>
is perfectly legal.
<SYNC Start=3245754><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3247594><P Class=EGCC>
It's just a question of a bet,<br>
you see.
<SYNC Start=3249954><P Class=EGCC>
A bet?<br>
That's right.
<SYNC Start=3251834><P Class=EGCC>
A man...
<SYNC Start=3254034><P Class=EGCC>
or in your case, mutatis mutandis,<br>
a woman
<SYNC Start=3256554><P Class=EGCC>
can bet on anything he pleases.
<SYNC Start=3258994><P Class=EGCC>
Whether it will rain tomorrow?
<SYNC Start=3261154><P Class=EGCC>
Whether the Russians can send a man<br>
to the moon?
<SYNC Start=3263634><P Class=EGCC>
Or...whether...
<SYNC Start=3265714><P Class=EGCC>
Mrs X...will die before Christmas.
<SYNC Start=3270314><P Class=EGCC>
Do you follow?
<SYNC Start=3272634><P Class=EGCC>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I saw<br>
you at Kensal Green Cemetery.
<SYNC Start=3275954><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3277074><P Class=EGCC>
Er...
<SYNC Start=3279234><P Class=EGCC>
You did. I would have mentioned it<br>
myself,
<SYNC Start=3282074><P Class=EGCC>
but running into you again,
<SYNC Start=3284274><P Class=EGCC>
I didn't want you to get the idea<br>
I was some kind of oddball, you know.
<SYNC Start=3288994><P Class=EGCC>
Following you.<br>
What were you doing?
<SYNC Start=3291274><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3292714><P Class=EGCC>
I was visiting my late godmother Min.
<SYNC Start=3295514><P Class=EGCC>
More properly,<br>
Lady Minerva Hesketh-Dubois.
<SYNC Start=3300394><P Class=EGCC>
BRADLEY:<br>
Let's assume a hypothetical case.
<SYNC Start=3303394><P Class=EGCC>
Someone would like to know when<br>
Great Aunt Eliza is going to die.
<SYNC Start=3308194><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3309394><P Class=EGCC>
Eliza could live on, pepped up by<br>
doctors, for another ten years.
<SYNC Start=3313114><P Class=EGCC>
You'd be delighted,<br>
you're fond of the old girl.
<SYNC Start=3315634><P Class=EGCC>
But how useful would it be to know?
<SYNC Start=3318554><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3319994><P Class=EGCC>
You follow?<br>
Oh, yes.
<SYNC Start=3322394><P Class=EGCC>
This is where yours truly comes in.
<SYNC Start=3324354><P Class=EGCC>
You bet me a certain sum...
<SYNC Start=3327834><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3328994><P Class=EGCC>
..that Aunt Eliza will be hale and<br>
hearty till Christmas.
<SYNC Start=3333034><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3334714><P Class=EGCC>
I bet that she won't.
<SYNC Start=3336914><P Class=EGCC>
There's nothing against that, is<br>
there?
<SYNC Start=3339474><P Class=EGCC>
She was a...decent old stick.
<SYNC Start=3342314><P Class=EGCC>
Good innings, mind.
<SYNC Start=3344354><P Class=EGCC>
71.
<SYNC Start=3346394><P Class=EGCC>
But she went through it, poor thing.
<SYNC Start=3348594><P Class=EGCC>
I mean it was quick,<br>
quick as you like, but...
<SYNC Start=3351034><P Class=EGCC>
all over in a week. But...
<SYNC Start=3353154><P Class=EGCC>
you wouldn't let a dog suffer like<br>
that.
<SYNC Start=3355674><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3356874><P Class=EGCC>
She wasted away to skin and bone.
<SYNC Start=3359474><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3360674><P Class=EGCC>
Her hair...<br>
Her hair?
<SYNC Start=3362634><P Class=EGCC>
It just came out.
<SYNC Start=3365234><P Class=EGCC>
Clumps.
<SYNC Start=3367194><P Class=EGCC>
Dignity. You know.
<SYNC Start=3369394><P Class=EGCC>
For a woman, especially, crowning<br>
glory, when all is said and done.
<SYNC Start=3373154><P Class=EGCC>
No matter how old you are.
<SYNC Start=3375154><P Class=EGCC>
You were fond of her?
<SYNC Start=3377034><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3378354><P Class=EGCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=3380274><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3381394><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, I suppose I was rather.
<SYNC Start=3383314><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3385914><P Class=EGCC>
She was always there when things...
<SYNC Start=3387834><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3388954><P Class=EGCC>
..got bad.
<SYNC Start=3390994><P Class=EGCC>
Did they get bad often?
<SYNC Start=3392874><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3395274><P Class=EGCC>
Once. Very.
<SYNC Start=3397194><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3402314><P Class=EGCC>
We draw up a contract, sign it,
<SYNC Start=3404354><P Class=EGCC>
I give you a date,
<SYNC Start=3406514><P Class=EGCC>
I say that a fortnight from that<br>
date...
<SYNC Start=3408914><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3410154><P Class=EGCC>
..Aunt Eliza's funeral service will<br>
be read.
<SYNC Start=3413274><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3414354><P Class=EGCC>
You say it won't.
<SYNC Start=3416554><P Class=EGCC>
Supposing you lose?<br>
Well, I pay up.
<SYNC Start=3419194><P Class=EGCC>
Naturally.
<SYNC Start=3421314><P Class=EGCC>
And if you lose...<br>
Supposing I don't...pay up?
<SYNC Start=3425794><P Class=EGCC>
I really shouldn't advise so.
<SYNC Start=3427954><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3429114><P Class=EGCC>
I'd like to think about it.<br>
Of course.
<SYNC Start=3431354><P Class=EGCC>
Of course, by all means, yes.
<SYNC Start=3433434><P Class=EGCC>
Never rush into anything ever.
<SYNC Start=3435434><P Class=EGCC>
If you decide to do business,
<SYNC Start=3437554><P Class=EGCC>
you come back and we'll go into the<br>
matter more fully.
<SYNC Start=3440154><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3441274><P Class=EGCC>
No hurry in the world.
<SYNC Start=3443274><P Class=EGCC>
No hurry at all.
<SYNC Start=3445194><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3446314><P Class=EGCC>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=3448394><P Class=EGCC>
Where does the pale horse fit in?
<SYNC Start=3451314><P Class=EGCC>
More things in heaven and earth,<br>
Horatio, than are dreamed of...
<SYNC Start=3455594><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3456794><P Class=EGCC>
Don't ask me how they do it.<br>
I don't know.
<SYNC Start=3458954><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3460034><P Class=EGCC>
But rest assured...
<SYNC Start=3461994><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3463114><P Class=EGCC>
..whatever it is they do do...
<SYNC Start=3465034><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3466114><P Class=EGCC>
..it works.
<SYNC Start=3468034><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3477474><P Class=EGCC>
Bradley, eh?
<SYNC Start=3479554><P Class=EGCC>
I should have known.
<SYNC Start=3481754><P Class=EGCC>
Caused us no end of trouble over the<br>
years.
<SYNC Start=3483914><P Class=EGCC>
But he's a slippery customer.
<SYNC Start=3486194><P Class=EGCC>
Knows every legal dodge in the book.
<SYNC Start=3488394><P Class=EGCC>
Somehow always stays<br>
just the right side of the line.
<SYNC Start=3491434><P Class=EGCC>
But we were talking about murder.<br>
Organised murder.
<SYNC Start=3494354><P Class=EGCC>
That's partly what I can't square.
<SYNC Start=3496714><P Class=EGCC>
Bradley's a wrong'un, but...
<SYNC Start=3498914><P Class=EGCC>
something like that? The chance of<br>
having his neck stretched?
<SYNC Start=3502474><P Class=EGCC>
I'd have said that was right off his<br>
beat.
<SYNC Start=3504634><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, I agree with you, Inspector.
<SYNC Start=3506834><P Class=EGCC>
Mr Bradley's involvement begins and<br>
ends with a financial transaction.
<SYNC Start=3511674><P Class=EGCC>
He's a go-between. <br>
Nothing more.
<SYNC Start=3514754><P Class=EGCC>
And I did hear back from Sir William<br>
Dougdale,
<SYNC Start=3518114><P Class=EGCC>
the nerve chap<br>
you asked me to get hold of.
<SYNC Start=3520394><P Class=EGCC>
No go, I'm afraid.
<SYNC Start=3522514><P Class=EGCC>
Venables has as much chance of<br>
walking as I have of flying.
<SYNC Start=3525754><P Class=EGCC>
You know, Inspector, despite all the<br>
evidence to the contrary,
<SYNC Start=3529314><P Class=EGCC>
I think it would still be worth one's<br>
while to keep an eye on Mr Venables.
<SYNC Start=3533274><P Class=EGCC>
Really?<br>
Oh, yes.
<SYNC Start=3535154><P Class=EGCC>
I would go so far as to say
<SYNC Start=3537394><P Class=EGCC>
he may well be key to unwrapping this<br>
whole affair.
<SYNC Start=3540514><P Class=EGCC>
There are dark forces at work here,<br>
Inspector.
<SYNC Start=3543034><P Class=EGCC>
They must be forced into the light.
<SYNC Start=3545834><P Class=EGCC>
Somehow I don't like the sound of<br>
that.
<SYNC Start=3547994><P Class=EGCC>
Whatever suspicions you may have,<br>
you must leave things to the police
<SYNC Start=3552314><P Class=EGCC>
and not take any action of your own.
<SYNC Start=3554274><P Class=EGCC>
No, no, of course, Inspector.
<SYNC Start=3556394><P Class=EGCC>
No, you're right. <br>
I wouldn't dream...
<SYNC Start=3559634><P Class=EGCC>
Dear me, no.
<SYNC Start=3561514><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3565267><P Class=EGCC>
According to the tail I put on<br>
Bradley,
<SYNC Start=3568427><P Class=EGCC>
he left yesterday in his lunch hour
<SYNC Start=3570787><P Class=EGCC>
to deliver a letter to an office<br>
on the other side of town.
<SYNC Start=3574187><P Class=EGCC>
The place looked derelict,<br>
but we've run it down.
<SYNC Start=3576987><P Class=EGCC>
Registered offices of<br>
Customer Reactions Classified.
<SYNC Start=3581307><P Class=EGCC>
Some sort of market research outfit.
<SYNC Start=3583507><P Class=EGCC>
The registrar of companies lists the<br>
director
<SYNC Start=3586187><P Class=EGCC>
as an Ian Morris Noone.<br>
With an "E".
<SYNC Start=3588547><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, well, it would be, wouldn't it?
<SYNC Start=3590587><P Class=EGCC>
It's a front obviously.
<SYNC Start=3592627><P Class=EGCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=3594667><P Class=EGCC>
Ian Morris Noone...
<SYNC Start=3596667><P Class=EGCC>
I, M, Noon.
<SYNC Start=3599227><P Class=EGCC>
I am no-one.
<SYNC Start=3601987><P Class=EGCC>
Or "I'm number one". Both probably.
<SYNC Start=3604907><P Class=EGCC>
The man's got a sense of humour,<br>
then.
<SYNC Start=3607387><P Class=EGCC>
And it would seem to confirm your<br>
instinct
<SYNC Start=3609387><P Class=EGCC>
that Bradley is just the middle man.
<SYNC Start=3611387><P Class=EGCC>
Forgive me, but wasn't there some<br>
mention of consumer reactions
<SYNC Start=3614907><P Class=EGCC>
with regard to Mrs Davis?
<SYNC Start=3617987><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, but the neighbours say that
<SYNC Start=3620067><P Class=EGCC>
no-one's been near the office in<br>
months.
<SYNC Start=3622147><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3623347><P Class=EGCC>
You really think the Pale Horse is<br>
connected? Don't you?
<SYNC Start=3627387><P Class=EGCC>
It's a big jump from putting on
<SYNC Start=3629427><P Class=EGCC>
scare shows for the gullible to<br>
actual murder
<SYNC Start=3632027><P Class=EGCC>
All these people who died, presumably<br>
somebody profited by their deaths.
<SYNC Start=3636227><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, yes. Lady Hesketh-Dubois<br>
left about Â£50,000.
<SYNC Start=3640187><P Class=EGCC>
Niece and nephew inherit.<br>
Both could do with the money.
<SYNC Start=3643307><P Class=EGCC>
But both were abroad<br>
when she fell ill.
<SYNC Start=3645547><P Class=EGCC>
Thomasina Tuckerton, her father left<br>
a very large fortune
<SYNC Start=3648707><P Class=EGCC>
but since she died unmarried before<br>
the age of 21...
<SYNC Start=3651347><P Class=EGCC>
It reverts to her stepmother.
<SYNC Start=3653467><P Class=EGCC>
It's pretty much the same story with<br>
the whole list. Yes.
<SYNC Start=3656347><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3657547><P Class=EGCC>
I think it's time we spoke to Miss<br>
Corrigan.
<SYNC Start=3660227><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3662427><P Class=EGCC>
Why?
<SYNC Start=3664387><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3677387><P Class=EGCC>
Good heavens.

For God's sake, woman.

here until the end of the week.
<SYNC Start=3721947><P Class=EGCC>
I've been called back to work.<br>
An emergency at the gallery.
<SYNC Start=3725347><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, I am sorry.<br>
I shall be sad to see you go.
<SYNC Start=3728027><P Class=EGCC>

Thank you.
<SYNC Start=3732107><P Class=EGCC>
Mrs Grey,
<SYNC Start=3734107><P Class=EGCC>
I wonder could you do me a favour?
<SYNC Start=3736267><P Class=EGCC>

misplaced a glove.

you said?
<SYNC Start=4098467><P Class=EGCC>
Rather foolishly,<br>
and to my everlasting shame,
<SYNC Start=4102147><P Class=EGCC>
I dismissed it as belonging to<br>
fiction.
<SYNC Start=4104707><P Class=EGCC>
But you got me thinking.
<SYNC Start=4106947><P Class=EGCC>
After all,
<SYNC Start=4109107><P Class=EGCC>
what better cover for a murderer<br>
than a man confined to a wheel chair?
<SYNC Start=4113987><P Class=EGCC>
I don't understand. How did he<br>
manage to fool the doctors?
<SYNC Start=4117267><P Class=EGCC>
You mean he really does have a twin?<br>
Oh, no, no, no.
<SYNC Start=4119947><P Class=EGCC>
Nothing like that.

<SYNC Start=4141707><P Class=EGCC>
Well, well.
<SYNC Start=4143707><P Class=EGCC>
Brilliant, Miss Marple.
<SYNC Start=4145907><P Class=EGCC>

who visits the Harley Street<br>

<SYNC Start=4155627><P Class=EGCC>

<SYNC Start=4157747><P Class=EGCC>
As far as the world is concerned,<br>
Mr Venables is a hopeless invalid.

While, in truth, he's able to come<br>
and go as he pleases.
<SYNC Start=4165347><P Class=EGCC>
I thought there had to be an answer<br>
of some sort, but...
<SYNC Start=4168227><P Class=EGCC>
do you think it's enough?
<SYNC Start=4170347><P Class=EGCC>
I mean, it's just my word.
<SYNC Start=4173107><P Class=EGCC>
Well, we have to see what Inspector<br>

<SYNC Start=4176307><P Class=EGCC>
I suspect we may yet have to make a<br>
little magic of our own

in order to expose him.

<SYNC Start=4234307><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4239747><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4240867><P Class=EGCC>
Inspector,
<SYNC Start=4243067><P Class=EGCC>
I think I'd like to know what the<br>
hell is going on.
<SYNC Start=4245787><P Class=EGCC>
You come in here, you commandeer my<br>
hotel... It's a damned outrage.
<SYNC Start=4249747><P Class=EGCC>
Actually, Mr Venables, I believe<br>
there's a matter
<SYNC Start=4252547><P Class=EGCC>
on which you might be able to assist<br>
us.
<SYNC Start=4254507><P Class=EGCC>
Really? And what might that be?
<SYNC Start=4257227><P Class=EGCC>
On the 5th of March
<SYNC Start=4259387><P Class=EGCC>
a parish priest by the name of<br>
Father Gorman...
<SYNC Start=4262067><P Class=EGCC>
was murdered.<br>
In Westbourne Street, Paddington.
<SYNC Start=4265347><P Class=EGCC>
Is that so?
<SYNC Start=4267107><P Class=EGCC>
I must confess,<br>
now the moment's here,
<SYNC Start=4269227><P Class=EGCC>
I'm more than a little nervous.
<SYNC Start=4271387><P Class=EGCC>
I must admit, I'm somewhat<br>
apprehensive myself.
<SYNC Start=4274227><P Class=EGCC>
My only regret is I wish I could be<br>
there to see the look on his face.
<SYNC Start=4277907><P Class=EGCC>
Yes, but we must follow<br>
Inspector Lejeune's advice.
<SYNC Start=4280907><P Class=EGCC>
You're our star witness.<br>
Only you can identify him.
<SYNC Start=4284427><P Class=EGCC>
If this is to work,
<SYNC Start=4286587><P Class=EGCC>
we must time your entrance<br>
to maximum effect.
<SYNC Start=4289067><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4291551><P Class=EGCC>
You see, Father Gorman had been<br>
called out that particular evening
<SYNC Start=4295871><P Class=EGCC>
to attend the death bed<br>
of a Mrs Davis.
<SYNC Start=4298591><P Class=EGCC>
She had become unwittingly entangled<br>
in a criminal organisation
<SYNC Start=4302591><P Class=EGCC>
which specialised in the removal<br>
of unwanted persons
<SYNC Start=4306431><P Class=EGCC>
for a substantial fee.
<SYNC Start=4308591><P Class=EGCC>
These removals were ostensibly<br>
brought about
<SYNC Start=4311551><P Class=EGCC>
by what might be called<br>
psychological means.
<SYNC Start=4314431><P Class=EGCC>
So the victim dies a perfectly<br>
natural death.
<SYNC Start=4316871><P Class=EGCC>
Do you really believe that?
<SYNC Start=4319031><P Class=EGCC>
The headquarters of this<br>
organisation
<SYNC Start=4321271><P Class=EGCC>
is said to be a place called the<br>
"Pale Horse".
<SYNC Start=4323591><P Class=EGCC>
Thyrza Grey's nonsense?
<SYNC Start=4326511><P Class=EGCC>
You really believe she spouts some<br>
mumbo-jumbo
<SYNC Start=4329831><P Class=EGCC>
and as a result, somebody dies?
<SYNC Start=4331791><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, no, Mr Venables.
<SYNC Start=4333991><P Class=EGCC>
Cause of death<br>
is much simpler than that.
<SYNC Start=4337191><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4338311><P Class=EGCC>
Thallium poisoning.
<SYNC Start=4340511><P Class=EGCC>
What did you say?<br>
Poisoning.
<SYNC Start=4342431><P Class=EGCC>
By thallium salts.
<SYNC Start=4344591><P Class=EGCC>
Only, the killer was at pains<br>
to disguise that fact.
<SYNC Start=4348111><P Class=EGCC>
And what better method
<SYNC Start=4350631><P Class=EGCC>
than a pseudo-scientific<br>
psychological set-up?
<SYNC Start=4354151><P Class=EGCC>
Full of modern jargon and reinforced<br>
by old superstitions.
<SYNC Start=4357951><P Class=EGCC>
Thallium salts?
<SYNC Start=4360151><P Class=EGCC>
I don't think I've heard of that<br>
one.
<SYNC Start=4362151><P Class=EGCC>
No? It's extensively used<br>
as rat poison.
<SYNC Start=4365711><P Class=EGCC>
More specifically,<br>
for animals with ringworm.
<SYNC Start=4369431><P Class=EGCC>
Odourless, tasteless.
<SYNC Start=4371431><P Class=EGCC>
It's obtained quite easily.
<SYNC Start=4373631><P Class=EGCC>
In fact, I think that Inspector<br>
Lejeune retrieved a jar of it
<SYNC Start=4377871><P Class=EGCC>
from your house only this morning.
<SYNC Start=4380391><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4384071><P Class=EGCC>
I know nothing about that.
<SYNC Start=4386071><P Class=EGCC>
Nothing at all.
<SYNC Start=4388271><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, your enterprise is very well<br>
organised, Mr Venables.
<SYNC Start=4392431><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4393551><P Class=EGCC>
Financial details arranged by a<br>
debarred solicitor,
<SYNC Start=4396511><P Class=EGCC>
name of Bradley.
<SYNC Start=4398591><P Class=EGCC>
Mr Bradley has an office in town
<SYNC Start=4401751><P Class=EGCC>
and prospective clients who want rid
<SYNC Start=4404311><P Class=EGCC>
of a wealthy relative for their own<br>
gain,
<SYNC Start=4406791><P Class=EGCC>
visit him there and do business.
<SYNC Start=4408991><P Class=EGCC>
That is to say, there is a bet made<br>
on whether someone will die
<SYNC Start=4412311><P Class=EGCC>
within a stated period.
<SYNC Start=4414351><P Class=EGCC>
When Mr Bradley wins his bet,
<SYNC Start=4417551><P Class=EGCC>
the money has to be paid over quite<br>
promptly.
<SYNC Start=4420111><P Class=EGCC>
Or something unpleasant<br>
is liable to happen.
<SYNC Start=4423151><P Class=EGCC>
That's all Mr Bradley has to do.
<SYNC Start=4425591><P Class=EGCC>
Make a bet.
<SYNC Start=4427711><P Class=EGCC>
Simple, isn't it?
<SYNC Start=4429671><P Class=EGCC>
It would certainly seem so.
<SYNC Start=4431791><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, it is so, Mr Venables.
<SYNC Start=4433911><P Class=EGCC>
For, barring the depositing of<br>
certain monies together with
<SYNC Start=4437311><P Class=EGCC>
the name of the intended victim to a<br>
certain address,
<SYNC Start=4440311><P Class=EGCC>
that's the end of Mr Bradley's role<br>
in the affair.
<SYNC Start=4442751><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4444351><P Class=EGCC>
Miss Marple.<br>
Thank you, Inspector.
<SYNC Start=4446711><P Class=EGCC>
The client then comes here to the<br>
Pale Horse,
<SYNC Start=4449911><P Class=EGCC>
where a show is put on<br>
by Mrs Grey and her friends
<SYNC Start=4453671><P Class=EGCC>
which usually impresses<br>
in the way it's meant to.
<SYNC Start=4456351><P Class=EGCC>
I hope you're not suggesting that<br>
I'm involved.
<SYNC Start=4458871><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, no, not at all.
<SYNC Start=4460991><P Class=EGCC>
Well, not in the actual killing.
<SYNC Start=4463151><P Class=EGCC>
Although that's certainly<br>
the impression
<SYNC Start=4465431><P Class=EGCC>
you like to give, Mrs Grey, isn't it?
<SYNC Start=4467471><P Class=EGCC>
Cat got your tongue, Mrs Grey?
<SYNC Start=4470271><P Class=EGCC>
I thought as much.
<SYNC Start=4472431><P Class=EGCC>
For all that you enjoy letting<br>
people think
<SYNC Start=4474831><P Class=EGCC>
that you really do have power over<br>
life and death,
<SYNC Start=4477631><P Class=EGCC>
like Bradley, your involvement was<br>
merely so much pantomime.
<SYNC Start=4481151><P Class=EGCC>
Pantomime?<br>
Financially rewarding no doubt,
<SYNC Start=4483631><P Class=EGCC>
but pantomime all the same.
<SYNC Start=4485831><P Class=EGCC>
How dare you!<br>
Oh, I dare.
<SYNC Start=4487831><P Class=EGCC>
You see, this whole rigmarole you<br>
lay on down here
<SYNC Start=4491311><P Class=EGCC>
is simply part of the murderer's<br>
grand design.
<SYNC Start=4493991><P Class=EGCC>
It's a failsafe. Like Bradley.<br>
Another way of keeping
<SYNC Start=4497031><P Class=EGCC>
the real killer at one remove from<br>
everybody else.
<SYNC Start=4499871><P Class=EGCC>
And if anyone should go to the<br>
police
<SYNC Start=4501951><P Class=EGCC>
with wild tales of murder being<br>
committed by black magic, well...
<SYNC Start=4506031><P Class=EGCC>
we'd as soon phone the funny farm<br>
as Scotland Yard.
<SYNC Start=4509591><P Class=EGCC>
You mean people really have died?
<SYNC Start=4513351><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4515031><P Class=EGCC>
My God.
<SYNC Start=4516951><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4518431><P Class=EGCC>
We didn't know. Tell them, Thyrza.
<SYNC Start=4521391><P Class=EGCC>
We didn't even know who it was we<br>
were meant to be cursing.
<SYNC Start=4524831><P Class=EGCC>
Well, not their names.
<SYNC Start=4527031><P Class=EGCC>
And there was never any money<br>
involved.
<SYNC Start=4528951><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4530151><P Class=EGCC>
Tell them, Thyrza.<br>
Oh, for God's sake, Sybil.
<SYNC Start=4533391><P Class=EGCC>
How else do you think we've kept<br>
afloat
<SYNC Start=4535231><P Class=EGCC>
since the bypass went through?
<SYNC Start=4537431><P Class=EGCC>
Do you think all of this<br>
just pays for itself?
<SYNC Start=4540351><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4545511><P Class=EGCC>
I just...
<SYNC Start=4547511><P Class=EGCC>
thought...
<SYNC Start=4549431><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4550391><P Class=EGCC>
..it was a bit of fun.
<SYNC Start=4552391><P Class=EGCC>
Fun, Miss Stamfordis?
<SYNC Start=4554311><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4556751><P Class=EGCC>
And now to the simple facts behind<br>
the scenes, as it were.
<SYNC Start=4560871><P Class=EGCC>
Certain women, to the best of their<br>
knowledge,
<SYNC Start=4563831><P Class=EGCC>
bona fide employees<br>
of a consumer research concern,
<SYNC Start=4567191><P Class=EGCC>
are sent by the anonymous head of the<br>
enterprise
<SYNC Start=4570631><P Class=EGCC>
to canvas a particular neighbourhood<br>
with a questionnaire.
<SYNC Start=4574431><P Class=EGCC>
What bread do you prefer?
<SYNC Start=4576631><P Class=EGCC>
What toilet articles,<br>
cosmetics do you use?
<SYNC Start=4579351><P Class=EGCC>
And so to the last step.
<SYNC Start=4581871><P Class=EGCC>
The only action performed by
<SYNC Start=4584591><P Class=EGCC>
the mysterious head of the enterprise<br>
himself.
<SYNC Start=4588151><P Class=EGCC>
He may pose as a plumber,<br>
electrician,
<SYNC Start=4591151><P Class=EGCC>
a workman of some kind,
<SYNC Start=4593231><P Class=EGCC>
in order to gain entry.
<SYNC Start=4595351><P Class=EGCC>
But whatever his role,<br>
his object is simple.
<SYNC Start=4599111><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4600231><P Class=EGCC>
Replacing an article he knows,
<SYNC Start=4602431><P Class=EGCC>
by means of the consumer research<br>
questionnaire, that his victim uses,
<SYNC Start=4606351><P Class=EGCC>
with a poisoned substitute.
<SYNC Start=4609431><P Class=EGCC>
Which sooner or later<br>
does its deadly work.
<SYNC Start=4612111><P Class=EGCC>
The victim falls ill.
<SYNC Start=4614311><P Class=EGCC>
A doctor is called, but sees no<br>
reason to imagine anything untoward.
<SYNC Start=4619151><P Class=EGCC>
You see, but for the hair loss,
<SYNC Start=4621711><P Class=EGCC>
thallium poisoning looks like nothing<br>
more than a natural death.
<SYNC Start=4626111><P Class=EGCC>
You see the beauty of this scheme,<br>
Mr Venables?
<SYNC Start=4629271><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4630471><P Class=EGCC>
The only person who knows what the<br>
head of the organisation
<SYNC Start=4633911><P Class=EGCC>
actually does is the head of the<br>
organisation himself.
<SYNC Start=4636911><P Class=EGCC>
There is no-one to give him away.
<SYNC Start=4638871><P Class=EGCC>
No-one to give him away?
<SYNC Start=4640991><P Class=EGCC>
What utter tosh.
<SYNC Start=4642951><P Class=EGCC>
What about Bradley?
<SYNC Start=4645471><P Class=EGCC>
What about the witches?
<SYNC Start=4647631><P Class=EGCC>
Neither Mr Bradley nor anyone at the<br>
Pale Horse
<SYNC Start=4650311><P Class=EGCC>
so much as know his name,<br>
never mind what he looks like.
<SYNC Start=4653391><P Class=EGCC>
You see, that's the key to the whole<br>
operation.
<SYNC Start=4656071><P Class=EGCC>
Mr Bradley is handsomely paid, of<br>
course,
<SYNC Start=4658231><P Class=EGCC>
as is Mrs Grey.
<SYNC Start=4660351><P Class=EGCC>
But so far as the world is concerned,
<SYNC Start=4662311><P Class=EGCC>
the man behind it doesn't even exist.
<SYNC Start=4665111><P Class=EGCC>
So how do you know so much?
<SYNC Start=4667311><P Class=EGCC>
There's nothing so reliable in court<br>
as the testimony of an eyewitness.
<SYNC Start=4671831><P Class=EGCC>
For example, Mr Venables,
<SYNC Start=4675111><P Class=EGCC>
this gentleman here is willing to<br>
swear
<SYNC Start=4678191><P Class=EGCC>
he saw you following Father Gorman<br>
on the night of the 5th of March.
<SYNC Start=4681751><P Class=EGCC>
I did see you.
<SYNC Start=4683791><P Class=EGCC>
I described you exactly.
<SYNC Start=4685991><P Class=EGCC>
Didn't I, Miss Marple?<br>
Yes, you did.
<SYNC Start=4688271><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4690231><P Class=EGCC>
Rather too exactly perhaps.
<SYNC Start=4692431><P Class=EGCC>
Because I'm afraid you didn't see Mr<br>
Venables
<SYNC Start=4694871><P Class=EGCC>
that night you were waiting for the<br>
ambulance.
<SYNC Start=4697391><P Class=EGCC>
What?<br>
Let me introduce you, Mr Venables,
<SYNC Start=4699751><P Class=EGCC>
to Mr Paul Osbourne, late of Benthall<br>
Street, Paddington.
<SYNC Start=4704671><P Class=EGCC>
You'll feel a personal interest in<br>
him when I tell you
<SYNC Start=4707631><P Class=EGCC>
that Mr Osbourne, who, like yourself,<br>
has been under observation
<SYNC Start=4711911><P Class=EGCC>
by Inspector Lejeune for quite some<br>
time,
<SYNC Start=4714511><P Class=EGCC>
was unwise enough to plant a jar<br>
of thallium salts in your house
<SYNC Start=4719311><P Class=EGCC>
only this morning.
<SYNC Start=4721511><P Class=EGCC>
No, I didn't.<br>
Be quiet.
<SYNC Start=4723511><P Class=EGCC>
You see,<br>
not knowing of your condition,
<SYNC Start=4725871><P Class=EGCC>
Mr Osbourne amused himself by casting<br>
you as the villain of the piece.
<SYNC Start=4729871><P Class=EGCC>
Miss Marple...
<SYNC Start=4731991><P Class=EGCC>
And being a very greedy, as well as a<br>
very vain and very stupid young man,
<SYNC Start=4736191><P Class=EGCC>
he refused to admit<br>
he'd made a mistake.
<SYNC Start=4738751><P Class=EGCC>
Worse, he tried to implicate you<br>
further
<SYNC Start=4741631><P Class=EGCC>
by murdering Rupert Cottam.
<SYNC Start=4744071><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4745231><P Class=EGCC>
Who should we look to if murder was<br>
suspected other than the man
<SYNC Start=4749431><P Class=EGCC>
with whom the late captain had such<br>
a longstanding and bitter feud?
<SYNC Start=4753951><P Class=EGCC>
How do you suppose I managed to<br>
achieve that?
<SYNC Start=4756471><P Class=EGCC>
You said yourself that's not how<br>
thallium works.
<SYNC Start=4759031><P Class=EGCC>
But it wasn't thallium you used on<br>
poor Captain Cottam.
<SYNC Start=4762071><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, no.
<SYNC Start=4764191><P Class=EGCC>
In the kitchen, Inspector, you will<br>
find a jar of dried beetles.
<SYNC Start=4768391><P Class=EGCC>
Lytta vesicatoria<br>
of the meloidae family.
<SYNC Start=4770871><P Class=EGCC>
More commonly known, I believe,<br>
as "Spanish fly".
<SYNC Start=4774351><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4775671><P Class=EGCC>
Crushed to a powder,
<SYNC Start=4777831><P Class=EGCC>
and in the minutest doses, it has a<br>
reputation as a powerful aphrodisiac.
<SYNC Start=4781831><P Class=EGCC>
Alas,
<SYNC Start=4784031><P Class=EGCC>
the potion I saw Lydia Harsnet buy<br>
from Bella Ellis,
<SYNC Start=4788031><P Class=EGCC>
as I believe was their longstanding<br>
arrangement,
<SYNC Start=4791391><P Class=EGCC>
was of no such minute dose.
<SYNC Start=4793711><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4794911><P Class=EGCC>
But rather one that had been tampered<br>
with
<SYNC Start=4797231><P Class=EGCC>
and prepared to a lethal strength.
<SYNC Start=4799391><P Class=EGCC>
So that when Captain Cottam drank it,<br>
voluntarily,
<SYNC Start=4803351><P Class=EGCC>
his insides were burned beyond<br>
saving.
<SYNC Start=4806031><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4817871><P Class=EGCC>
Argh!
<SYNC Start=4819831><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4822111><P Class=EGCC>
Is that not the case, Mrs Harsnet?
<SYNC Start=4824311><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4826471><P Class=EGCC>
Lydia?
<SYNC Start=4828391><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4829511><P Class=EGCC>
Kanga, I'm... I'm so sorry.
<SYNC Start=4832191><P Class=EGCC>
Ru insisted.
<SYNC Start=4834311><P Class=EGCC>
We'd used it before.
<SYNC Start=4836311><P Class=EGCC>
Well, you know we had.
<SYNC Start=4838191><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4840431><P Class=EGCC>
You!
<SYNC Start=4842511><P Class=EGCC>
Wicked, wicked boy!
<SYNC Start=4844551><P Class=EGCC>
How could you?
<SYNC Start=4846591><P Class=EGCC>
Even then one couldn't be sure
<SYNC Start=4848631><P Class=EGCC>
that Paul Osbourne was the brains<br>
behind it all.
<SYNC Start=4851351><P Class=EGCC>
The mysterious head of the<br>
enterprise.
<SYNC Start=4854071><P Class=EGCC>
Not without seeing how he was going<br>
about it.
<SYNC Start=4857031><P Class=EGCC>
So we asked Mr Easterbrook
<SYNC Start=4859511><P Class=EGCC>
to commission a little murder of our<br>
own.
<SYNC Start=4862031><P Class=EGCC>
As Inspector Lejeune says,
<SYNC Start=4864231><P Class=EGCC>
there's nothing so reliable<br>
as an eyewitness.
<SYNC Start=4866911><P Class=EGCC>
Miss Corrigan.
<SYNC Start=4869031><P Class=EGCC>
This brave girl put her life at risk.
<SYNC Start=4871191><P Class=EGCC>
Is this the man who came to your<br>
door this morning to read the meter?
<SYNC Start=4875191><P Class=EGCC>
Yes!<br>
That's a lie.
<SYNC Start=4877231><P Class=EGCC>
It's her word against mine.<br>
You've not one whit of proof.
<SYNC Start=4880351><P Class=EGCC>
We have.
<SYNC Start=4882511><P Class=EGCC>
Officers were watching Miss<br>
Corrigan's flat.
<SYNC Start=4884871><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4888391><P Class=EGCC>
You were seen entering<br>
and leaving the building.
<SYNC Start=4891391><P Class=EGCC>
You're lying!
<SYNC Start=4893391><P Class=EGCC>
If that were the case,
<SYNC Start=4895551><P Class=EGCC>
you would have arrested me<br>
there and then.
<SYNC Start=4897871><P Class=EGCC>
And miss giving you a chance
<SYNC Start=4899871><P Class=EGCC>
to plant thallium at Mr Venables'<br>
house?
<SYNC Start=4901991><P Class=EGCC>
Miss Marple thought<br>
you might go for it.
<SYNC Start=4904151><P Class=EGCC>
And you did.
<SYNC Start=4906191><P Class=EGCC>
Hubris, inspector.
<SYNC Start=4908351><P Class=EGCC>
The arrogance of a murderer who's<br>
escaped justice for so long
<SYNC Start=4911631><P Class=EGCC>
he thinks no-one will ever catch him.
<SYNC Start=4913911><P Class=EGCC>
You have no idea what you're talking<br>
about.
<SYNC Start=4916631><P Class=EGCC>
Perhaps you're right.
<SYNC Start=4918751><P Class=EGCC>
Perhaps it was another Paul Osbourne
<SYNC Start=4920951><P Class=EGCC>
who was imprisoned at the age of 12<br>
for murder?
<SYNC Start=4923631><P Class=EGCC>
Having poisoned his stepfather.
<SYNC Start=4925551><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4927151><P Class=EGCC>
Too young to hang, he was detained<br>
at His Majesty's pleasure,
<SYNC Start=4930711><P Class=EGCC>
until he was deemed cured<br>
and ready for release.
<SYNC Start=4933991><P Class=EGCC>
But he was not cured.
<SYNC Start=4936231><P Class=EGCC>
For there was nothing wrong with him<br>
in the first place
<SYNC Start=4939271><P Class=EGCC>
beyond a greed for money and a<br>
propensity for wickedness.
<SYNC Start=4942631><P Class=EGCC>
And for that, I'm afraid,<br>
there is no cure.
<SYNC Start=4945511><P Class=EGCC>
Save one.<br>
You dare...
<SYNC Start=4947831><P Class=EGCC>
..to call me stupid?
<SYNC Start=4950551><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4951951><P Class=EGCC>
If you knew...
<SYNC Start=4954151><P Class=EGCC>
If you had any idea...<br>
what I've done.
<SYNC Start=4957951><P Class=EGCC>
Oh, I know what you've done, Paul!
<SYNC Start=4960391><P Class=EGCC>
You killed Father Gorman.
<SYNC Start=4962511><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4965351><P Class=EGCC>
Argh!
<SYNC Start=4967271><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4977831><P Class=EGCC>
And now I know why.
<SYNC Start=4980031><P Class=EGCC>
Really? You realised Mrs Davis<br>
would have told him
<SYNC Start=4982951><P Class=EGCC>
what she knew of the Pale Horse.
<SYNC Start=4985191><P Class=EGCC>
And how do you imagine Mrs Davis<br>
knew about the Pale Horse?
<SYNC Start=4989831><P Class=EGCC>
I imagine it began with something as<br>
simple
<SYNC Start=4992551><P Class=EGCC>
as recognising a client's name<br>
in the obituaries column.
<SYNC Start=4996111><P Class=EGCC>
And once you've seen one, well...
<SYNC Start=4997991><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4999191><P Class=EGCC>
I suspect she followed Bradley<br>
back from one of his trips
<SYNC Start=5002671><P Class=EGCC>
to the headquarters of Customer<br>
Reactions.
<SYNC Start=5005151><P Class=EGCC>
Consulted him perhaps,<br>
much the same as we did.
<SYNC Start=5007911><P Class=EGCC>
And that's what led her here.
<SYNC Start=5009911><P Class=EGCC>
And, well, you couldn't have that.
<SYNC Start=5012551><P Class=EGCC>
So you poisoned her.
<SYNC Start=5014711><P Class=EGCC>
You suspected Mrs Davis knew the<br>
names
<SYNC Start=5016711><P Class=EGCC>
of all the people you had murdered.
<SYNC Start=5018831><P Class=EGCC>
Well, you were right.<br>
She'd made a list.
<SYNC Start=5020911><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5024511><P Class=EGCC>
You think you know it all,<br>
don't you?
<SYNC Start=5026591><P Class=EGCC>
We'll see who has the last laugh.
<SYNC Start=5029591><P Class=EGCC>
You'll be sorry.
<SYNC Start=5031631><P Class=EGCC>
I presume by that
<SYNC Start=5033791><P Class=EGCC>
you're referring to the pot of face<br>
cream I keep on the dresser?
<SYNC Start=5036911><P Class=EGCC>
The one you laced with thallium.
<SYNC Start=5039111><P Class=EGCC>
Well, fortunately for me,<br>
I'm rather set in my ways
<SYNC Start=5043711><P Class=EGCC>
and I always keep the labels on my<br>
potions turned towards me.
<SYNC Start=5047671><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5048791><P Class=EGCC>
It's so much quicker
<SYNC Start=5050871><P Class=EGCC>
to see what you're looking for.
<SYNC Start=5052791><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5054511><P Class=EGCC>
But you're ill.<br>
As I said...
<SYNC Start=5056671><P Class=EGCC>
I may well be coming down<br>
with a cold.
<SYNC Start=5059151><P Class=EGCC>
Your hair.<br>
Window dressing, Mr Osbourne.
<SYNC Start=5062591><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5063471><P Class=EGCC>
As Mrs Grey will confirm.
<SYNC Start=5065991><P Class=EGCC>
The trick with magic...
<SYNC Start=5067911><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5069031><P Class=EGCC>
..is always to show the audience
<SYNC Start=5071831><P Class=EGCC>
exactly what it is they expect to<br>
see.
<SYNC Start=5074311><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5075231><P Class=EGCC>
Now you see it.
<SYNC Start=5077151><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5078591><P Class=EGCC>
Now you don't.
<SYNC Start=5080671><P Class=EGCC>
You...
<SYNC Start=5082711><P Class=EGCC>
are an interfering old witch.
<SYNC Start=5084751><P Class=EGCC>
And I'll kill...
<SYNC Start=5086951><P Class=EGCC>
You won't be killing anybody,<br>
not where you're going.
<SYNC Start=5089871><P Class=EGCC>
Get him out!
<SYNC Start=5091911><P Class=EGCC>
You'll all be sorry!
<SYNC Start=5094591><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5095871><P Class=EGCC>
Not as sorry as he'll be...
<SYNC Start=5097911><P Class=EGCC>
I fancy. My apologies, Miss Marple.
<SYNC Start=5100711><P Class=EGCC>
No, no, Inspector.
<SYNC Start=5102791><P Class=EGCC>
Not at all.
<SYNC Start=5104671><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5106271><P Class=EGCC>
You know, I...
<SYNC Start=5108271><P Class=EGCC>
I rather think I'd like a brandy.
<SYNC Start=5110431><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5111591><P Class=EGCC>
I'm astounded, Miss Marple.
<SYNC Start=5114351><P Class=EGCC>
I had my mind firmly set on Mr<br>
Venables.
<SYNC Start=5116391><P Class=EGCC>
You might have given me a hint.
<SYNC Start=5118591><P Class=EGCC>
I couldn't afford to give any hints,<br>
I'm afraid.
<SYNC Start=5121311><P Class=EGCC>
One has to play these things<br>
very close to one's chest.
<SYNC Start=5124391><P Class=EGCC>
In truth,<br>
we didn't have very much to go on.
<SYNC Start=5127471><P Class=EGCC>
Which is why we staged things<br>
the way we did.
<SYNC Start=5130431><P Class=EGCC>
With Mr Venables' co-operation,<br>
of course.
<SYNC Start=5133311><P Class=EGCC>
Most fun I've had in years.
<SYNC Start=5135191><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5136871><P Class=EGCC>
We had to lead Osbourne up the path
<SYNC Start=5139591><P Class=EGCC>
then turn on him suddenly.
<SYNC Start=5141631><P Class=EGCC>
And hope to break him down.
<SYNC Start=5143671><P Class=EGCC>
Look, look, look.
<SYNC Start=5145551><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5148431><P Class=EGCC>
Just as I thought.
<SYNC Start=5150391><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5153471><P Class=EGCC>
And it worked.
<SYNC Start=5155511><P Class=EGCC>
When did you begin to suspect him?
<SYNC Start=5157391><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5158511><P Class=EGCC>
Well...
<SYNC Start=5160751><P Class=EGCC>
it's extraordinarily difficult to<br>
make up a description of anybody.
<SYNC Start=5165191><P Class=EGCC>
Try it. You'll find you're<br>
unconsciously describing
<SYNC Start=5168511><P Class=EGCC>
someone you know or you've seen<br>
somewhere.
<SYNC Start=5171311><P Class=EGCC>
I'd say Osbourne saw Mr Venables<br>
sitting in his car one day
<SYNC Start=5176271><P Class=EGCC>
here in Much Deeping
<SYNC Start=5178431><P Class=EGCC>
and was very struck by his<br>
appearance.
<SYNC Start=5180471><P Class=EGCC>
But if he'd seen him that way,
<SYNC Start=5182471><P Class=EGCC>
he wouldn't know he's confined to a<br>
wheelchair.
<SYNC Start=5184911><P Class=EGCC>
And what about Thyrza Grey's part in<br>
all this?
<SYNC Start=5187351><P Class=EGCC>
Sybil Stamfordis and Bella.
<SYNC Start=5190231><P Class=EGCC>
I wouldn't worry too much about them,<br>
Mr Venables.
<SYNC Start=5193151><P Class=EGCC>
I shouldn't be surprised<br>
if some dark and moonless night,
<SYNC Start=5197591><P Class=EGCC>
they just mounted their broomsticks<br>
and slipped quietly away.
<SYNC Start=5201271><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5202391><P Class=EGCC>
Cheers.

<SYNC Start=5216231><P Class=EGCC>
Well, Miss Corrigan.
<SYNC Start=5218271><P Class=EGCC>
Good to see you looking so well.
<SYNC Start=5220231><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5221951><P Class=EGCC>
Thank you, for everything.<br>
If it hadn't been for you...
<SYNC Start=5225191><P Class=EGCC>
No, it's Father Gorman<br>
we should thank
<SYNC Start=5227271><P Class=EGCC>
and Mrs Davis.
<SYNC Start=5229311><P Class=EGCC>
They set the ball rolling.
<SYNC Start=5231351><P Class=EGCC>
And paid for it with their lives.
<SYNC Start=5233511><P Class=EGCC>
You gave her justice, Miss Marple,<br>
Mrs Davis. And Tommy Tuckerton,
<SYNC Start=5236991><P Class=EGCC>
Lady Hesketh-Dubois, Father Gorman,<br>
all of them.
<SYNC Start=5239431><P Class=EGCC>
WE gave them justice.
<SYNC Start=5241551><P Class=EGCC>
So thank you, both of you,
<SYNC Start=5243671><P Class=EGCC>
agreeing to take part<br>
in our little subterfuge.
<SYNC Start=5246271><P Class=EGCC>
I hear Mr Easterbrook played his<br>
part to perfection.
<SYNC Start=5248911><P Class=EGCC>
According to Inspector Lejeune,
<SYNC Start=5250871><P Class=EGCC>
Mr Bradley still can't believe<br>
you were a stooge.
<SYNC Start=5253471><P Class=EGCC>
He really did think<br>
you wanted me out of the way.
<SYNC Start=5255791><P Class=EGCC>
I suspect, my dear, that nothing<br>
can be further from the truth.
<SYNC Start=5259671><P Class=EGCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5260751><P Class=EGCC>
Well, I'd...I'd better be...
