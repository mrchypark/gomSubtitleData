<SYNC Start=27758>Excuse me. I'm sorry.
<SYNC Start=30378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=31300>I'm sorry.
<SYNC Start=32717>Excuse me. Coming through.
<SYNC Start=34507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=36383><i>Tonight, so-called</i><br>
<i>magician Lionel shrike</i>
<SYNC Start=38342><i>is making another sad</i><br>
<i>attempt for attention</i>
<SYNC Start=40842><i>by performing what he calls</i><br>
<i>an impossible feat.</i>
<SYNC Start=44382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=44383><i>The safe is made of</i><br>
<i>the strongest iron.</i>
<SYNC Start=47717><i>It can't be sawed</i><br>
<i>through or pried.</i>
<SYNC Start=50877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=50883><i>Yet, Lionel shrike thinks</i><br>
<i>he's able to escape.</i>
<SYNC Start=55383>Dad! Dad!
<SYNC Start=57343>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=58675>Hey, buddy.
<SYNC Start=60045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=60050>You made it, huh?
<SYNC Start=61925>Now, see that seat there?
<SYNC Start=65505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=65508>Is Lionel shrike<br>
the kind of magician<br>
who can pull this off?
<SYNC Start=71378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=71383><i>Or is he actually</i><br>
<i>in over his head?</i>
<SYNC Start=74383>We'll see about that.
<SYNC Start=75883>What's the matter?
<SYNC Start=77050>I don't want you to go.
<SYNC Start=78425>Dylan, come on.<br>
We talked about this.
<SYNC Start=80625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=80633>Remember?<br>
This is what I do.
<SYNC Start=82925>I got to prove all<br>
those naysayers wrong.
<SYNC Start=85585>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=85592>Okay? Besides...
<SYNC Start=88508>I always keep<br>
something up my sleeve.
<SYNC Start=91588>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=91592>Now, got your watch<br>
like your dad's?
<SYNC Start=93722>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=94467>Okay. How many seconds?
<SYNC Start=96377>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=96383>300.
<SYNC Start=97842>300. Maybe a few less.
<SYNC Start=99512>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=101842>Mmm.
<SYNC Start=103550>I love you so much.
<SYNC Start=105340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=106925>Okay.<br>
See you later, big man.
<SYNC Start=109875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=109883><i>- Ladies and gentlemen,</i><br>
<i>- Lionel shrike!</i>
<SYNC Start=114683>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=116050>Will he be able<br>
to hold his breath?
<SYNC Start=118300><i>Will he be able to</i><br>
<i>somehow escape the safe?</i>
<SYNC Start=121930>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=125633>Three, two, one...
<SYNC Start=127683>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=132967>Two, three,
<SYNC Start=134547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=134550>four, five, six,<br>
seven, eight...
<SYNC Start=139050>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=139883>296...
<SYNC Start=142050>297, 298, 299, 300.
<SYNC Start=147340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=150467>303, 304...
<SYNC Start=153377>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=154383><i>It's five minutes now,</i>
<SYNC Start=155467><i>and we have not</i><br>
<i>seen or heard anything</i><br>
<i>from Lionel shrike yet.</i>
<SYNC Start=161507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=161508>Move!
<SYNC Start=162718>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=163925>Dad!
<SYNC Start=165045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=166425>Dad! Dad!
<SYNC Start=168875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=170717>Let go of me!
<SYNC Start=172297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=172925>Dad!
<SYNC Start=174335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=175467>No! Dad!
<SYNC Start=176587>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=178425>Dad! Let go!
<SYNC Start=180505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=181550>Find him!
<SYNC Start=182800>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=202883><i>The eye.</i>
<SYNC Start=204303>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=204883><i>It may not lie...</i>
<SYNC Start=206883><i>But don't think for a moment</i><br>
<i>that it can't be lied to.</i>
<SYNC Start=210553>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=212300><i>Seeing is believing.</i>
<SYNC Start=215050><i>But is it truth?</i>
<SYNC Start=217050><i>People see the horsemen</i><br>
<i>as noble Robin hoods.</i>
<SYNC Start=220508><i>Are they?</i>
<SYNC Start=221675><i>Or are they common thieves?</i>
<SYNC Start=224875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=224883><i>Depends on your point of view.</i>
<SYNC Start=226383>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=227508><i>They robbed a bank in Paris</i><br>
<i>from a stage in las Vegas.</i>
<SYNC Start=232717><i>They fleeced</i><br>
<i>an insurance magnate</i>
<SYNC Start=234425><i>of hundreds of</i><br>
<i>millions of dollars</i>
<SYNC Start=235965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=235967><i>and disappeared from</i><br>
<i>a roof in New York.</i>
<SYNC Start=238717><i>Always showering their</i><br>
<i>devoted fans with money.</i>
<SYNC Start=242925><i>Here's what you don't know.</i>
<SYNC Start=244875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=244883><i>They left one man behind.</i>
<SYNC Start=247050><i>Framed. Holding the bag.</i>
<SYNC Start=249010>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=249842><i>Me.</i>
<SYNC Start=250882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=252550><i>Are you listening, horsemen?</i>
<SYNC Start=254630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=254633><i>When you emerge,</i><br>
<i>and you will...</i>
<SYNC Start=257843>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=258883><i>I will be there waiting.</i>
<SYNC Start=261925><i>Because mark my words,</i>
<SYNC Start=264375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=264383><i>you will get</i><br>
<i>what's coming to you.</i>
<SYNC Start=267383><i>In ways you can't expect.</i>
<SYNC Start=269763>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=270758><i>But very much deserve.</i>
<SYNC Start=273378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=273383><i>Because one thing</i><br>
<i>I believe in</i>
<SYNC Start=276383><i>is any eye for an eye.</i>
<SYNC Start=279683>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=356842><i>Welcome, Daniel atlas.</i>
<SYNC Start=358762>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=359717>Who am I speaking to?
<SYNC Start=361047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=362508>I asked to see the face<br>
behind all of this.
<SYNC Start=364588>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=365842><i>You've asked many questions.</i>
<SYNC Start=367717><i>And registered</i><br>
<i>many complaints.</i>
<SYNC Start=370297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=370300><i>You can rest assured</i><br>
<i>that we've heard you.</i>
<SYNC Start=372380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=372383>Have you? Because I don't...
<SYNC Start=373883><i>Trust?</i><br>
<i>No.</i>
<SYNC Start=375383><i>Your leader?</i><br>
<i>Your fellow horsemen?</i>
<SYNC Start=378050>I don't like<br>
that we've been living<br>
in hiding for a year.
<SYNC Start=383717>I don't like<br>
that every message<br>
i get from Dylan is,
<SYNC Start=385925>"wait. Be patient.
<SYNC Start=387465>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=387467>"The eye has a plan."
<SYNC Start=388717><i>Wait. Be patient.</i>
<SYNC Start=391047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=391050><i>The eye has a plan.</i>
<SYNC Start=392508>This is games and<br>
it's not working for me.
<SYNC Start=395548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=395550><i>You feel it is you</i><br>
<i>who should be leading</i><br>
<i>the horsemen,</i>
<SYNC Start=399050><i>not Dylan.</i>
<SYNC Start=400550>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=402383><i>If that is</i><br>
<i>what you desire,</i>
<SYNC Start=403633><i>stay the course.</i>
<SYNC Start=406008><i>Trust that</i><br>
<i>your unique talents</i>
<SYNC Start=408048>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=408050><i>and remarkable mind</i><br>
<i>will not go unrecognized.</i>
<SYNC Start=411967><i>We have a new mission</i><br>
<i>for the horsemen.</i>
<SYNC Start=414717><i>Dylan has a plan</i><br>
<i>and will gather</i><br>
<i>you together soon.</i>
<SYNC Start=417837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=418967><i>Now leave!</i>
<SYNC Start=420677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=434633>...north Carolina,<br>
Florida, Maryland, Maine.
<SYNC Start=436967>We're talking the entire<br>
eastern seaboard.
<SYNC Start=439547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=439550>I need to see some results.
<SYNC Start=441508>Oh, hey. Oh, sorry.
<SYNC Start=443425>Just real quick.<br>
Can I have you for<br>
a couple of minutes?
<SYNC Start=445505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=445508>I'm right in the middle<br>
of something, Dylan.
<SYNC Start=446758>No, I know. It's okay.<br>
Hey. Hey, everybody. Sorry.
<SYNC Start=448717>Sorry about that.
<SYNC Start=450925>Call the mayor.
<SYNC Start=452335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=452342>Thanks a lot.<br>
Twins, huh? Good.
<SYNC Start=454722>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=455550>Is he coming?
<SYNC Start=456925>Look, I wouldn't<br>
have brought you<br>
out of that meeting
<SYNC Start=459045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=459050>unless it was<br>
something important.
<SYNC Start=460717>It's about<br>
the horsemen.
<SYNC Start=463047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=463050>Something's happening here<br>
and it's happening now.
<SYNC Start=466425>Message boards.<br>
Elite magic society.
<SYNC Start=469045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=469050>There is chatter going on<br>
about the horsemen
<SYNC Start=471675>and something happening<br>
with octa, the giant<br>
software company.
<SYNC Start=474505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=474508>I know what octa is.
<SYNC Start=476008>I'm sorry, ma'am,<br>
but two months ago
<SYNC Start=477838>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=477842>we sent men<br>
to Philadelphia<br>
because he knew...
<SYNC Start=479342>And I said<br>
that I was wrong.
<SYNC Start=480425>He knew that<br>
the horsemen
<SYNC Start=482045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=482050>were going to hit<br>
the euro-Atlantic<br>
banking summit.
<SYNC Start=483050>I have proof.
<SYNC Start=484340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=484342>Let him talk.<br>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=485717>Communications.
<SYNC Start=487337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=487342>Contact between who I think<br>
might be Daniel atlas
<SYNC Start=491382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=491383>and who may be<br>
merritt mckinney.
<SYNC Start=494008>And what do you have?<br>
Emails? Cell phones?
<SYNC Start=496048>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=496050>Any transcripts?
<SYNC Start=497550>Pigeons.<br>
What?
<SYNC Start=499717>I'm sorry,<br>
you mean stool pigeons?
<SYNC Start=502047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=502050>No, I mean<br>
actual pigeon pigeons.<br>
Like carrier pigeons.
<SYNC Start=504800>Okay? Magicians work
<SYNC Start=506380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=506383>with pigeons.<br>
Doves.
<SYNC Start=507843>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=508925>Stay with me.
<SYNC Start=511465>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=511467>This pigeon,<br>
right here...
<SYNC Start=513675>There's Daniel atlas.<br>
Same pigeon.
<SYNC Start=516425>East village.
<SYNC Start=517545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=517550>Same pigeon, west village.
<SYNC Start=519300>42nd street, pigeon.<br>
65th street.
<SYNC Start=521967>All the way up to the<br>
George Washington bridge
<SYNC Start=524925>on a sail boat<br>
with a guy
<SYNC Start=527465>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=527467>that looks just<br>
like merritt mckinney.
<SYNC Start=529675>And what does<br>
this all mean?
<SYNC Start=531045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=531050>I know<br>
what it means.
<SYNC Start=532380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=532383>It means nothing.<br>
It's bullshit.
<SYNC Start=533675>Could you<br>
sing a new song?<br>
No.
<SYNC Start=535505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=535508>How is it that<br>
two years ago<br>
you were so close...
<SYNC Start=537548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=537550>You think I went<br>
out of my way to screw up<br>
my own investigation?
<SYNC Start=540050>But you want everybody<br>
else to think that<br>
you're an idiot.
<SYNC Start=544340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=544342>Okay, stop.
<SYNC Start=546382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=546383>Cowan, I know I'm new here,<br>
but as far as I can tell,
<SYNC Start=549467>people who don't<br>
even know you,<br>
think you're an asshole.
<SYNC Start=551757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=552675>You don't know me,<br>
but my first year<br>
in the academy,
<SYNC Start=556755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=556758>you gave a talk.
<SYNC Start=558048>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=558050>The "long game"<br>
you called it.
<SYNC Start=559880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=559883>You talked about<br>
a moral compass.
<SYNC Start=562675>About how you believed<br>
in yours immutably.
<SYNC Start=564875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=566675>And I thought to myself,<br>
"that guy.
<SYNC Start=569045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=569050>"One day,<br>
i want to be that guy."
<SYNC Start=572010>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=573633>And now... a pigeon?
<SYNC Start=576342>Technically, it was<br>
a few pigeons, but I hear<br>
what you're saying.
<SYNC Start=578550>Okay.<br>
So here's what<br>
I'm going to do.
<SYNC Start=580050>You want to take<br>
a vacation day?
<SYNC Start=581630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=581633>But I'm not going<br>
to devote resources<br>
to another snipe hunt.
<SYNC Start=586592>I came to clean this mess up,<br>
not add to it. I'm sorry.
<SYNC Start=589758>Boss, thank you.
<SYNC Start=590878>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=590883>I promise you,<br>
it won't be a snipe hunt.
<SYNC Start=593425>We're gonna get<br>
those horsemen.
<SYNC Start=595795>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=595800>She's great.
<SYNC Start=596925>The problem is
<SYNC Start=598715>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=598717>when you're two people<br>
at the same time,
<SYNC Start=600337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=600342>one of them is bound<br>
to trip the other.
<SYNC Start=601758>And when that happens,
<SYNC Start=603425>I will be there.
<SYNC Start=605045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=605633>Duly noted.
<SYNC Start=606883>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=628342>Oh. Hi!<br>
Who are you?
<SYNC Start=629882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=629883>What are you doing in my...<br>
It's actually<br>
a funny story.
<SYNC Start=631717>How did you get<br>
into my apartment?<br>
Whoa!
<SYNC Start=633425>I think it's funny.<br>
It's not like funny "ha ha."
<SYNC Start=635715>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=635717>Or you might not think<br>
that it's funny "ha ha."
<SYNC Start=637877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=637883>I think it's funny.<br>
I guess it's all<br>
kind of relative.
<SYNC Start=640383>I was actually...<br>
No, that's not...
<SYNC Start=642383>I made myself in<br>
the neighborhood<br>
and now I'm here,
<SYNC Start=644592>and maybe...
<SYNC Start=645882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=648717>Okay.
<SYNC Start=649877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=649883>Seriously,<br>
how did you<br>
get in here?
<SYNC Start=651717>Are you some kind<br>
of crazed fan<br>
or something?
<SYNC Start=653717>Oh, my god.<br>
No, no, no,<br>
i recognize you.
<SYNC Start=655717>You did that b-grade
<SYNC Start=657467>"geek magic" thing,<br>
didn't you?<br>
You pulled a...
<SYNC Start=658877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=658883>Pulled a hat<br>
out of the rabbit.
<SYNC Start=660050>A hat out of the rabbit,<br>
that's right.
<SYNC Start=661467>I know<br>
that it didn't work.
<SYNC Start=662627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=662633>No, it was actually<br>
kind of disgusting.
<SYNC Start=663758>Well, your drop was obvious<br>
and your body shell is flimsy.
<SYNC Start=668717>So if you wouldn't mind
<SYNC Start=669967>crawling out from<br>
under my couch and...
<SYNC Start=672297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=675758>Ta-da! Now I'm sitting<br>
over here. Crazy!
<SYNC Start=678548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=678550>By the way,<br>
that rabbit thing?
<SYNC Start=680508>That was eight<br>
years ago, okay?
<SYNC Start=682338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=682342>I've gotten so much<br>
better since then.
<SYNC Start=683967>Have you?<br>
Yeah.
<SYNC Start=685717>Okay, come here.<br>
What is it<br>
that you want?
<SYNC Start=686967>I wanted to meet you.<br>
Everybody, really.
<SYNC Start=688675>I want to be a part<br>
of the eye, okay?
<SYNC Start=690505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=690508>I said it. I do.<br>
And I want to use<br>
my magic for good,
<SYNC Start=693548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=693550>like you and merritt<br>
and Jack especially.
<SYNC Start=696880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=696883>Oh, that's right.<br>
I know that Jack is alive.
<SYNC Start=698967>I know that he<br>
faked his own death.
<SYNC Start=700425>I am a huge fan<br>
of faking deaths.
<SYNC Start=701755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=701758>That was crazy!
<SYNC Start=703378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=703383>What is this?<br>
A trucker's hitch?
<SYNC Start=704883>Yeah.<br>
It's terrible.
<SYNC Start=706758>Embarrassing.<br>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=708878>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=708883>By the way,<br>
i am so sorry<br>
that henley left you.
<SYNC Start=711925>- Ow! God!<br>
- Sorry.
<SYNC Start=713835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=713842>That's actually<br>
a little better.
<SYNC Start=715342>You know what I heard?
<SYNC Start=716508>I heard that<br>
she got tired<br>
of waiting around.
<SYNC Start=720378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=720383>She lost faith<br>
and so she asked<br>
for an out,
<SYNC Start=722842>and the eye<br>
gave it to her.
<SYNC Start=724800>But who knows, right?
<SYNC Start=726050>In matters of the heart,<br>
so difficult to tell.
<SYNC Start=728300>I mean, maybe she got<br>
sick of you.
<SYNC Start=729550>You ever think<br>
about that?
<SYNC Start=730717>Maybe you just<br>
didn't tie her up<br>
tight enough. Ow!
<SYNC Start=733925>Mmm. Here's what's<br>
going to happen.
<SYNC Start=735505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=735508>You're going to stay<br>
here and stop talking,
<SYNC Start=737798>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=737800>and I'm going to<br>
make a phone call,
<SYNC Start=739425>and in about five minutes,<br>
some people are going...
<SYNC Start=741755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=748342>- It's all in the wrist.<br>
Uh-huh.
<SYNC Start=750508>Let the momentum<br>
of the card<br>
do the work for you.
<SYNC Start=753588>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=753592>Mmm-hmm.
<SYNC Start=754758>This last one<br>
i call the stall.
<SYNC Start=756718>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=759425>Not bad.
<SYNC Start=761005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=761008>Now you want to see<br>
a thing of beauty?
<SYNC Start=762717>I do indeed.<br>
Here you go.
<SYNC Start=764547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=764550>And bingo bango bongo.
<SYNC Start=766800>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=768717>No, no, no,<br>
it's good<br>
to be positive
<SYNC Start=771547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=771550>despite making zero<br>
progress in a year.
<SYNC Start=773050>Yeah.
<SYNC Start=774340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=774342>Whereas when it<br>
comes to hypnotism,
<SYNC Start=776342>the student has almost<br>
become the master.
<SYNC Start=778675>I like your confidence,
<SYNC Start=780875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=780883>but you might say that<br>
you have the better teacher.
<SYNC Start=783425>Ooh!<br>
Yeah.
<SYNC Start=784545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=784550>Your teacher<br>
definitely doesn't know<br>
what he's doing.
<SYNC Start=788050>By the way, was this<br>
your card yesterday?
<SYNC Start=790050>In fact it was.
<SYNC Start=791380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=791383>I thought so.
<SYNC Start=792592>That's not bad.
<SYNC Start=794342>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=799383>If I can hypnotize Danny<br>
before you hit him<br>
with a card,
<SYNC Start=801717>I get top bunk<br>
for a week.
<SYNC Start=803047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=803050>Okay, that's a deal.
<SYNC Start=805050>Stare at the palm<br>
of your hand and as<br>
your eyes change focus,
<SYNC Start=808717>you will begin<br>
to notice...
<SYNC Start=810007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=810008>It's not working.<br>
Please don't become him.
<SYNC Start=814378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=814383>I didn't know you guys<br>

<SYNC Start=815967>when there weren't<br>
floozies around<br>
to impress.
<SYNC Start=817757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=817758>Uh, I think we stopped<br>
trying to impress floozies
<SYNC Start=820048>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=820050>in, like, 1937.
<SYNC Start=822425>Okay, somebody broke<br>
into my apartment,<br>
all right?
<SYNC Start=824545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=824550>Some amateur who knew<br>
everything about me,
<SYNC Start=826380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=826383>everything about<br>
henley leaving,
<SYNC Start=827675>and everything about us.
<SYNC Start=828875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=828883>That's her.
<SYNC Start=830008>Hey!
<SYNC Start=831717>Hi.
<SYNC Start=832837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=832842>You met lula.
<SYNC Start=833967>I've met her.<br>
What is she doing here?
<SYNC Start=836627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=836633>I'm the new horseman!
<SYNC Start=838553>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=839925>I'm the girl horseman.
<SYNC Start=841675>Whoo!
<SYNC Start=843375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=843383>Yeah!
<SYNC Start=844553>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=845550>Nobody.<br>
No excitement.
<SYNC Start=846717>Jack? Anything?
<SYNC Start=848047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=848050>Dylan, tell me<br>
what's going on here.
<SYNC Start=850050>Well, lula's been on<br>
the underground scene<br>
for the last decade,
<SYNC Start=854800>and I think she<br>
has some real talent,
<SYNC Start=856550>and I'd like to<br>
try her on stage
<SYNC Start=858630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=858633>to balance out the duo.<br>
What?
<SYNC Start=860800>No, are you serious, man?
<SYNC Start=862758>After henley left,<br>
you said I could<br>
get back on stage again.
<SYNC Start=864378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=864383>Not someone who<br>
just showed up.
<SYNC Start=865758>And I really need you<br>
behind the scenes with me<br>
for a little while longer.
<SYNC Start=869925>Dylan, come on.<br>
I've been behind<br>
the scenes my whole life.
<SYNC Start=872335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=872342>Which is a crime,<br>
might I add. Have you<br>
seen that man's face?
<SYNC Start=874842>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=876050>The addition<br>
of some femininity<br>
to the group,
<SYNC Start=879925>over and above<br>
what atlas provides...
<SYNC Start=882375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=882383>I think the real issue<br>
is we've been in this...
<SYNC Start=884717>Yeah, the issue<br>
is that we have been<br>
rehearsing for months
<SYNC Start=887047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=887050>for something...<br>
We don't even<br>
know what it is.
<SYNC Start=889880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=889883>And you're going to<br>
keep working until...
<SYNC Start=890967>Until we work as<br>
a single organism.
<SYNC Start=892047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=892050>I know, I've heard<br>
you say that.
<SYNC Start=893340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=893342>I think what<br>
you're referring to<br>
is us, not you.
<SYNC Start=897342>Listen, I'm getting<br>
my orders directly<br>
from the eye.
<SYNC Start=899632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=899633>Okay? And then<br>
i give them to you.
<SYNC Start=901300>Now, if you don't like that,<br>
you're welcome to go.
<SYNC Start=902717>No, I'm not going anywhere.<br>
But I'm... mmm.
<SYNC Start=904007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=904008>Guys, can i<br>
just weigh in here<br>
really quickly?
<SYNC Start=906878>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=906883>Because I think I see<br>
what's going on here.
<SYNC Start=908550>You guys are this amazing,<br>
tight-knit family unit.
<SYNC Start=911467>I'm a new person...<br>
We are anything<br>
but a family.
<SYNC Start=913797>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=913800>Okay, well, my mother
<SYNC Start=915758>literally knifed my father<br>
in the neck one time.
<SYNC Start=917878>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=917883>So you are actually<br>
a little bit like<br>
my family unit.
<SYNC Start=919925>Literally?<br>
But, yeah.
<SYNC Start=921375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=921383>It was an accident,<br>
i think.
<SYNC Start=923383>Okay. So, does this mean<br>
we're actually going<br>
to do something?
<SYNC Start=926508>Yes.
<SYNC Start=928628>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=928633>You've all heard of octa<br>
and their playboy ceo,<br>
Owen case.
<SYNC Start=933050>His partner, Walter mabry,<br>
died about a year ago.
<SYNC Start=935717>You wanna know<br>
what all this has<br>
been leading to?
<SYNC Start=937047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=937050>Octa's hosting the launch<br>
of the next-gen cell phone.
<SYNC Start=940717>Once these phones<br>
hit the streets,
<SYNC Start=942675>they'll siphon<br>
their users' information<br>
to the black market.
<SYNC Start=945585>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=945592>Meaning octa's<br>
selling privacy<br>
to up their profit.
<SYNC Start=949382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=949383>So, the eye has decided<br>
to expose them for it.
<SYNC Start=952383>Our mission<br>

the world puts<br>
its guard down.
<SYNC Start=2086008>I'm able to control<br>
quite a few companies,
<SYNC Start=2088048>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2088050>including my old partner,<br>
Owen's,
<SYNC Start=2090380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2090383>as a consortium of so-called<br>
anonymous shareholders.
<SYNC Start=2092883>And that violates<br>
how many sec laws?
<SYNC Start=2095425>I believe it<br>
breaks all of them.
<SYNC Start=2096715>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2096717>All of them.
<SYNC Start=2098297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2098300>You see,<br>
you all want an audience.
<SYNC Start=2101008>Need one, desperately.
<SYNC Start=2103298>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2103300>It's quite sad, really.
<SYNC Start=2104590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2104592>Hence, my ability<br>
to nab you.
<SYNC Start=2106717>I, on the other hand,<br>
want the opposite of that.
<SYNC Start=2109675>I just want to be, and I am
<SYNC Start=2112295>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2112300>100% off the grid.
<SYNC Start=2114008>You know why?
<SYNC Start=2115548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2115550>Yeah, because the grid<br>
is for actual human beings.
<SYNC Start=2117967>No, because in a world<br>
of total surveillance,
<SYNC Start=2120547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2120550>the only true freedom<br>
lies in not being seen.
<SYNC Start=2123717>You can't control the grid<br>
from within the grid.
<SYNC Start=2125967>Follow me.<br>
Yeah.
<SYNC Start=2127967>Follow me.<br>
Okay. All right.
<SYNC Start=2129837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2129842>You pulled a hat<br>
out of a rabbit.<br>
That was very colorful.
<SYNC Start=2132342>Almost eight and<br>
a half years ago.
<SYNC Start=2134008>So, no need<br>
to bring that up.
<SYNC Start=2135838>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2135842>We can't all be held<br>
accountable for our<br>
adolescent personas.
<SYNC Start=2138550>Can we, magicolio?
<SYNC Start=2140717>Magicolio,<br>
that was 15 years ago.
<SYNC Start=2143297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2143300>Like you, and many others who,<br>
i suppose, were not getting<br>
any sex in high school,
<SYNC Start=2148717>I dabbled with it.
<SYNC Start=2150627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2150633>But, uh, unlike you,<br>
i was able to<br>
transition upward
<SYNC Start=2152800>towards actual magic.
<SYNC Start=2154925>Science, you may<br>
have heard it called.
<SYNC Start=2156625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2159592>Would you like to know,<br>
my friends,<br>
just how I got you here?
<SYNC Start=2163967>We know how you did it.
<SYNC Start=2165377>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2165383>No, you don't.<br>
Yeah,
<SYNC Start=2167425>you stole our files<br>
for the show, then<br>
obviously hypnotized us.
<SYNC Start=2169375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2169383>The strobe was a combo<br>
of binaural beats,<br>
as well as...
<SYNC Start=2173342>I said stop!
<SYNC Start=2175675>You might not be<br>
having fun, but I am.
<SYNC Start=2179425>You have an unusual<br>
way of showing it.
<SYNC Start=2181505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2181967>So...
<SYNC Start=2183047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2183800>How did I do it?
<SYNC Start=2184880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2185717>You see, magicians<br>
like to control other<br>
people's perceptions.
<SYNC Start=2190047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2190050>In your heightened<br>
state of agitation,
<SYNC Start=2191717><i>you saw the simplest cues.</i><br>
<i>Black tube, roof.</i>
<SYNC Start=2194047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2194050><i>And your minds</i><br>
<i>filled in the rest.</i>
<SYNC Start=2196675><i>But the tube you</i><br>
<i>meant to go down</i><br>
<i>was 20 feet to your right.</i>
<SYNC Start=2199545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2199550>Go on, sit down.<br>
There's no one<br>
standing in your way.
<SYNC Start=2201675>Don't mind if I do.
<SYNC Start=2202795>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2204967>Anyway, once in the tube,<br>
yes, you're right...
<SYNC Start=2207297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2207300><i>Blah, blah, blah,</i><br>
<i>the strobe contained</i>
<SYNC Start=2209300><i>uv letters pulsing</i><br>
<i>the word "sleep."</i>
<SYNC Start=2211050><i>And that, combined with</i><br>
<i>the sound, put you into</i><br>
<i>an instant Alpha pattern.</i>
<SYNC Start=2216967><i>Sleep, sleep, sleep.</i>
<SYNC Start=2219837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2219842>And from then on,<br>
it really was just fun.
<SYNC Start=2221592>And I can assure you,
<SYNC Start=2222842>you don't know<br>
what happened.
<SYNC Start=2224972>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2229717>That's really creepy.
<SYNC Start=2230837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2230842>Really, really creepy.
<SYNC Start=2232722>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2235383>That's not cool.
<SYNC Start=2236800>Yep, easy stuff, magic,
<SYNC Start=2238510>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2239717>if you put your mind to it.
<SYNC Start=2241297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2241300>All right, that's enough.<br>
So why are we here, then?
<SYNC Start=2243340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2243342>Besides you getting<br>
to show off how<br>
adorably clever you are.
<SYNC Start=2245967>Well, to start with,<br>
the man you stole from<br>
last year,
<SYNC Start=2248877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2248883>turns out I had invested
<SYNC Start=2250342>quite a lot of money<br>
in some of his companies,
<SYNC Start=2251717>so a lot of what you<br>
stole was, in fact, mine.
<SYNC Start=2254967>Good news is,<br>
it's very easy for you<br>
to pay me back.
<SYNC Start=2257837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2257842>I just need your skills.
<SYNC Start=2260717>Owen and I were<br>
like the Beatles,<br>
if the Beatles had been...
<SYNC Start=2263587>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2263592>Elfin?
<SYNC Start=2264717>...geniuses.
<SYNC Start=2266047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2266050>Pretty sure the Beatles<br>
were geniuses.
<SYNC Start=2267840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2267842>And like them,<br>
we had a dream.
<SYNC Start=2269382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2270967>Could we create actual,<br>
genuine magic?
<SYNC Start=2274797>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2274800>And I'm guessing one of you<br>
achieved that dream,<br>
and it wasn't you?
<SYNC Start=2278300>That is what he<br>
would like you to think.
<SYNC Start=2281467>Was a perfect blend<br>
of elegance and technology.
<SYNC Start=2286675>But Owen<br>
wanted it for himself<br>
so he humiliated me
<SYNC Start=2288965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2288967>by exposing my private files<br>
to the board of directors
<SYNC Start=2292377>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2292383>and convinced them<br>
that I am unstable.
<SYNC Start=2293800>Did you take<br>
a picture of him<br>
while he was sleeping?
<SYNC Start=2295967>He had me kicked out of<br>
my own company,
<SYNC Start=2297547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2297550>taking credit for a chip<br>
that's not just<br>
the key to one computer,
<SYNC Start=2301717>but every computer<br>
system on the planet.
<SYNC Start=2304837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2304842>It can un-encrypt anything,<br>
crack the defense firewall,
<SYNC Start=2307967>manipulate markets,<br>
and spy on anyone.
<SYNC Start=2310837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2310842>And now it's being sold<br>
to the highest bidder.
<SYNC Start=2312717>If you're so rich,<br>
why don't you just buy it?
<SYNC Start=2314425>So he gets the money?
<SYNC Start=2315835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2315842>And the pleasure? No.
<SYNC Start=2318050>Why would I buy it<br>
when I could have you<br>
steal it for me?
<SYNC Start=2321550>It's being previewed tomorrow<br>
to the various suitors,
<SYNC Start=2325380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2325383>which will<br>
include your targets,
<SYNC Start=2326883>a crew lead by<br>
a south African gangster.
<SYNC Start=2328550>Yes. How your team<br>
gets past security,<br>
that's up to you.
<SYNC Start=2331800>But once you do, you just need<br>
to inspect it and steal it.
<SYNC Start=2334800>Come on, this is<br>
perfect for you, isn't it?
<SYNC Start=2337925>You're magicians and thieves.
<SYNC Start=2339715>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2339717>What makes you think<br>
we would even<br>
consider doing this?
<SYNC Start=2341877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2341883>Um, oh, wait, I had a reason.<br>
What was it? Oh, yes.
<SYNC Start=2345383>You see, back home,<br>
you're wanted criminals.
<SYNC Start=2346925>But here,<br>
i control the police,<br>
the casinos, the media.
<SYNC Start=2350375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2350383>I can give you a new life,<br>
out of hiding.
<SYNC Start=2353633>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2355050>And if you don't,<br>
I'll have you killed.
<SYNC Start=2357010>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2358967>You know what?
<SYNC Start=2360047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2360050>I'm not stealing<br>
a thing for you.
<SYNC Start=2361717>Not unless Dylan<br>
tells me it's okay.
<SYNC Start=2363547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2363550>Really?<br>
Dylan is where,<br>
exactly?
<SYNC Start=2365717>Yeah, I'm with him.<br>
So you can go<br>
ahead and kill us
<SYNC Start=2368877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2368883>because I'm not<br>
gonna steal anything<br>
for you either.
<SYNC Start=2370925>Strikes me<br>
that a consensus seems<br>
to be forming, Walter,
<SYNC Start=2374675>and we're calling<br>
your bluff.
<SYNC Start=2376375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2377883>Actually,<br>
we'll do it.<br>
What?
<SYNC Start=2379967>We're in Macau.<br>
The oldest magic store<br>
in the world is here.
<SYNC Start=2382837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2382842>We'll get<br>
the supplies we need,<br>
and we'll do it.
<SYNC Start=2386382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2386842>Thank you.
<SYNC Start=2388800>Chase will take you<br>
to the magic shop<br>
in the morning.
<SYNC Start=2393510>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2398550><i>Badge.</i>
<SYNC Start=2399590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2403342>Really?
<SYNC Start=2404552>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2406550>Thanks.
<SYNC Start=2407925>Agent cowan.
<SYNC Start=2409005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2411300>Your ID.
<SYNC Start=2412550>Oh, yeah. Thanks.
<SYNC Start=2413970>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2417967>It appears Mr. Bradley's<br>
still at dinner.
<SYNC Start=2420587>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2420592>Yeah? Tell him<br>
recess is over.
<SYNC Start=2423432>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2431300>What?
<SYNC Start=2432340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2450467>Where are they?<br>
I don't have time<br>
for bullshit.
<SYNC Start=2454007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2454008>Oh, I have all the time<br>
in the world, thanks to you.
<SYNC Start=2456675>And I didn't get to<br>
finish my lobster,
<SYNC Start=2458425>which makes me very grumpy.
<SYNC Start=2459925>Okay, let's cut the crap.<br>
What do you want?
<SYNC Start=2462875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2462883>You can dispense<br>
with the tough guy act<br>
to begin with.
<SYNC Start=2466300>You're too desperate<br>
for it to be believable.
<SYNC Start=2468760>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2470842>I said,<br>
what do you want?
<SYNC Start=2473550>You used<br>
a form 219 warrant
<SYNC Start=2475880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2475883>you found a connection<br>
between me<br>
and the four horsemen.
<SYNC Start=2479883>Which means
<SYNC Start=2482008>you can take me<br>
out of here<br>
on a 24-hour leave.
<SYNC Start=2484588>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2484592>You want me<br>
to break you out?
<SYNC Start=2485882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2487008>I want you<br>
to take me out.
<SYNC Start=2489588>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2489592>All you need is<br>
an extradition order,
<SYNC Start=2491882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2491883>which you'll find in<br>
that tray by my printer.
<SYNC Start=2493843>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2495717>I had nothing to do<br>
with the horsemen's<br>
disappearance.
<SYNC Start=2501007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2501008>You were lured<br>
into a trap.
<SYNC Start=2503717>And like Dorothy did<br>
when she landed in oz,
<SYNC Start=2506757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2506758>you're beginning<br>
to realize
<SYNC Start=2508967>that the only way out
<SYNC Start=2511627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2511633>is through.
<SYNC Start=2513008>And I'm the only one<br>
who can get you there.
<SYNC Start=2515628>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2516967>You got this place wired.
<SYNC Start=2518425>You don't need me<br>
to get out of here.
<SYNC Start=2520585>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2520592>This is all about payback.
<SYNC Start=2522632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2522633>I believe in<br>
an eye for an eye.
<SYNC Start=2524967>So you're out<br>
to destroy me?
<SYNC Start=2526547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2526550>You think I'm still gonna<br>
play your little game?
<SYNC Start=2529050>I know you will.
<SYNC Start=2530840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2530842>Because no matter<br>
how hard you try
<SYNC Start=2532882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2532883>to find a culprit<br>
behind all this,
<SYNC Start=2534883>you're going to blame<br>
only yourself.
<SYNC Start=2537467>When your little vendetta<br>
ended with you putting me<br>
in jail 18 months ago,
<SYNC Start=2542047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2542050>you got tired,<br>
you got sloppy. You<br>
stopped paying attention.
<SYNC Start=2545880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2545883>And that's where you lost.
<SYNC Start=2547973>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2551050>So,
<SYNC Start=2552717>you can save yourself,
<SYNC Start=2554717>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2556425>or you can make<br>
a deal with me,
<SYNC Start=2558715>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2558717>and save the four horsemen,
<SYNC Start=2560877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2560883>and stop wasting<br>
both of our time.
<SYNC Start=2564343>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2566467><i>Steal something</i>
<SYNC Start=2568877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2568883>for this narcissistic<br>
little man boy?<br>
I don't like it.
<SYNC Start=2571842>But what I like less<br>
is you deciding for us.
<SYNC Start=2573800>Yeah? Do you like that<br>
we're the laughing stocks<br>
of the magic world,
<SYNC Start=2576717>and the fugitives<br>
of the actual world?
<SYNC Start=2578587>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2578592>Walter is right.<br>
We have nowhere to go.
<SYNC Start=2580425>But we can fix that.
<SYNC Start=2581715>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2581717>We can fix it?<br>
Yeah.
<SYNC Start=2582967>So you're officially<br>
part of the team now?
<SYNC Start=2584587>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2584592>Excuse me?<br>
I'm sure this<br>
is what Dylan
<SYNC Start=2586508>meant when he said<br>
we should all work<br>
as a single organism.
<SYNC Start=2588628>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2588633>Yeah, that is a fairytale<br>
that Dylan tells himself,<br>
and tells us.
<SYNC Start=2591883>Look, even if<br>
we get this stick,<br>
he'll never let us go.
<SYNC Start=2594717>We can't trust Walter, okay?
<SYNC Start=2597047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2597050>The eye has<br>
a history in Macau.
<SYNC Start=2598840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2598842>They're the only<br>
ones we can trust.
<SYNC Start=2599882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2599883>Now, if we can<br>
get it to them,
<SYNC Start=2601842>they can clear our names<br>
and get us<br>
the hell out of here.
<SYNC Start=2603300>It's a bad plan, man.
<SYNC Start=2604800>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2612883>Hey.
<SYNC Start=2613973>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2614883>Hi, how are you?
<SYNC Start=2616343>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2616383>Um, we need some<br>
things custom-made.
<SYNC Start=2618425>Actually, by tomorrow.<br>
We're kind of in a rush.
<SYNC Start=2619965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2619967>And...
<SYNC Start=2621717>You have no idea what<br>
I'm talking about, do you?
<SYNC Start=2623467>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2629883>Welcome to iong's.<br>
My name's li. Not Bruce Lee.
<SYNC Start=2633342>What?<br>
Got you.
<SYNC Start=2634592>Okay.<br>
Look.
<SYNC Start=2635722>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2641300>Oh! And now it's<br>
by my head. How fun.
<SYNC Start=2643008>$20.<br>
$20?
<SYNC Start=2644717>No, thank you.<br>
We're kind of in a rush.
<SYNC Start=2646717>$10.<br>
Uh, no.
<SYNC Start=2648967>Okay, all right.<br>
Just give us<br>
the thumbs. Yeah?
<SYNC Start=2651967>Okay. Thanks a lot,<br>
Jack. Please take these.
<SYNC Start=2654425>So, we need<br>
a keplinger holdout,
<SYNC Start=2657045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2657050>and we also need<br>
roughing fluid,<br>
a sanada gimmick,
<SYNC Start=2660425>sleeves, tracks.<br>
This is all in plastic,<br>
though, if you can.
<SYNC Start=2663295>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2667717>What?
<SYNC Start=2668757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2670883>My grandmother<br>
wants to know why plastic?<br>
Plastic is cheap.
<SYNC Start=2675717>Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic<br>
because we're...
<SYNC Start=2678047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2678050>We're going through<br>
a very sensitive<br>
metal detector, okay?
<SYNC Start=2681717>So plastic, nothing.<br>
Metal...
<SYNC Start=2684627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2686675>It detects.
<SYNC Start=2687875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2693300>What did she say?
<SYNC Start=2695008>She said just because<br>
you're talking slowly<br>
and moving your hands
<SYNC Start=2697717>doesn't mean<br>
she can suddenly<br>
understand English.
<SYNC Start=2699717>Oh, yeah.
<SYNC Start=2700797>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2700800>So sorry. He's racist.
<SYNC Start=2702590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2702592>Listen, I know that<br>
the only thing<br>
that we agree on
<SYNC Start=2706842>is that our mom and dad<br>
had one too many children.
<SYNC Start=2710717>So why don't we just let<br>
the kids play with their toys
<SYNC Start=2713877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2713883>and go get<br>
a little drinkey-poo?
<SYNC Start=2715508>If it's free, it's me.
<SYNC Start=2716967>Great.
<SYNC Start=2718425>Guys, we'll be right back.
<SYNC Start=2720835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2720842>Okay, kiddies,<br>
the chaperones<br>
are watching you.
<SYNC Start=2724632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2724633>Don't do anything<br>
i wouldn't enjoy.
<SYNC Start=2726883>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2727883>Okay.<br>
Have fun, you two.
<SYNC Start=2730013>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2732425>Hey.
<SYNC Start=2733875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2733883>Can I use your phone?<br>
It's kind of important.
<SYNC Start=2735842>Sure.
<SYNC Start=2738008>On the house.<br>
Thanks.
<SYNC Start=2739758>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2741425>I'm arranging<br>
to hand over the stick.
<SYNC Start=2744005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2744008>So that's how we've been<br>
contacting the eye?
<SYNC Start=2745878>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2745883>You've been doing it<br>
on your own?
<SYNC Start=2747342>Maybe.
<SYNC Start=2748508>Oh, god.<br>
Dylan's not<br>
gonna like this.
<SYNC Start=2750878>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2750883>I'm not really concerned<br>
with what Dylan likes.
<SYNC Start=2752508>Okay?<br>
I'm doing this for us.
<SYNC Start=2754468>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2756550>What is wrong<br>
with this thing?
<SYNC Start=2758967>Hey, relax,<br>
it's just a kid's toy.
<SYNC Start=2760337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2760342>Yeah, that's<br>
what I thought.
<SYNC Start=2761682>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2761717>Okay. Let me just...<br>
Ow!
<SYNC Start=2763007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2763008>Sorry, sorry. Jesus.
<SYNC Start=2765628>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2767550>Hey, can you get this?
<SYNC Start=2769970>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2774550>It's like birth,<br>
you know.
<SYNC Start=2776590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2776592>One person<br>
enters the hospital,
<SYNC Start=2778800>two people come out.
<SYNC Start=2780050>Walk and talk.
<SYNC Start=2781675>I'll tell you<br>
on the plane.
<SYNC Start=2783965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2783967>What plane?
<SYNC Start=2786297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2786300>My sources tell me<br>
your horsemen<br>
are in Macau.
<SYNC Start=2789340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2789925>What's the look?
<SYNC Start=2791045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2791050>It's none of your business.
<SYNC Start=2792380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2792383>Who are your sources?
<SYNC Start=2793633>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2796300>Just some old friends.
<SYNC Start=2798380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2805050>When we have the card,<br>
where do I go?
<SYNC Start=2808300>And 0 for 52.
<SYNC Start=2810680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2810717>Well, it's perfect.<br>
It's a perfect score.
<SYNC Start=2813757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2814800>Then what about girls?
<SYNC Start=2817675>Like, relationships?
<SYNC Start=2819545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2819550>What?
<SYNC Start=2820760>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2824592>Look, it's not<br>
something I'm proud of,
<SYNC Start=2828300>but every girl<br>
i get close to,
<SYNC Start=2831880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2831883>I end up<br>
taking their trust.
<SYNC Start=2834383>And then their wallet.
<SYNC Start=2836883>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2837467>So...
<SYNC Start=2838627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2840925>You take their wallets?
<SYNC Start=2842545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2842550>Yeah.
<SYNC Start=2843630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2845758>You ever take<br>
their belts?
<SYNC Start=2847928>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2849425>Or how about
<SYNC Start=2850585>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2850592>some peanuts<br>
from the hotel bar?
<SYNC Start=2853842>Not sure why<br>
you took those.
<SYNC Start=2856842>I'm sorry, did you think<br>
that I was like<br>
those other girls?
<SYNC Start=2860012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2861550>Oh, Jack.
<SYNC Start=2863470>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2868967>Okay. So there's<br>
a marketplace<br>
down the street.
<SYNC Start=2871377>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2871383>And I'm meeting<br>
a man with a blue hat.
<SYNC Start=2873550>He'll get the stick<br>
to the right people<br>
and get us home.
<SYNC Start=2876380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2876383>You go grab merritt, okay?<br>
We got a lot to do.
<SYNC Start=2878425>And, hey,<br>
put your belt on.
<SYNC Start=2880295>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2880300>Oh, no, it's not...<br>
She took it off me and...
<SYNC Start=2884008>You know,<br>
the most heartbreaking<br>
moment of my life
<SYNC Start=2886967>was when I discovered
<SYNC Start=2889297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2889300>that you had stolen<br>
all my money and split.
<SYNC Start=2891800>I didn't realize until now
<SYNC Start=2893967>how much of that money<br>
you put into your face.
<SYNC Start=2896547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2896550>Seriously, is it weird<br>
to have more hair in your<br>
nose than on your head?
<SYNC Start=2901300>Speaking of, next time<br>
you get a hair transplant,
<SYNC Start=2903840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2903842>you might wanna<br>
consider requesting
<SYNC Start=2906632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2906633>something other<br>
than old man pubes.
<SYNC Start=2909550>You know what?<br>
You are such a buffoon,<br>
mer-bear.
<SYNC Start=2913675>And this little ploy<br>
you have
<SYNC Start=2915675>of stalling me<br>
while your friends<br>
screw over my employer?
<SYNC Start=2919835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2919842>Not gonna work.
<SYNC Start=2921552>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2923800>Chase!<br>
As you stare<br>
into my eyes,
<SYNC Start=2925675>you will find<br>
that you wanna sleep.
<SYNC Start=2928045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2928050>When you wake, you will beg<br>
for merritt's forgiveness
<SYNC Start=2930590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2930592>and realize that<br>
you will never be<br>
half the man that he is.
<SYNC Start=2934052>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2936008>Merritt,
<SYNC Start=2937298>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2937300>I am so, so<br>
very, very sorry
<SYNC Start=2942717>about how pathetic<br>
your pupil is.
<SYNC Start=2945547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2945550>Hey, a little hint<br>
on your technique<br>
of surprise.
<SYNC Start=2948800>It lacks that all-essential<br>
little element of surprise.
<SYNC Start=2952590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2953675>Hey, this has been fun,<br>
mer-bear.
<SYNC Start=2955925>Let's do it again<br>
sometime.
<SYNC Start=2958005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2961467>Well,
<SYNC Start=2962967>I've had ample time to do<br>
some research, and you know,
<SYNC Start=2966507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2966550>I think the eye<br>
might actually be real.
<SYNC Start=2971340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2971342>Thought you didn't<br>
buy into all that.
<SYNC Start=2972800>I'd be lying if i<br>
said I didn't think
<SYNC Start=2974840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2974842>that this road would lead<br>
to the great wizard<br>
behind the curtain
<SYNC Start=2978382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2978383>and, in the end,<br>
i might get to see his face.
<SYNC Start=2980883>Even if the fate of<br>
the horsemen depends on it?
<SYNC Start=2983842>Listen to me.<br>
I broke you out of there.
<SYNC Start=2985342>We're not<br>
changing the terms now.
<SYNC Start=2986592>You put me there!<br>
Yeah,
<SYNC Start=2987842>because you deserve<br>
to be there.
<SYNC Start=2989425>Listen, I did not<br>
kill your father.
<SYNC Start=2992045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2992050>All right, all right,<br>
let's just cut the bullshit.
<SYNC Start=2995967>I know who you are,
<SYNC Start=2998425>shrike.
<SYNC Start=2999675>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3000883>I know you blame me<br>
for your father's death.
<SYNC Start=3002967>I know you think<br>
i goaded him into performing<br>
a trick he couldn't pull off.
<SYNC Start=3007007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3007008>I know the time in<br>
jail was a result
<SYNC Start=3009425>of a 30-year revenge plot<br>
against me.
<SYNC Start=3011585>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3011592>Supposing that's all true,<br>
you think I'd tell you now?
<SYNC Start=3014300>Man.
<SYNC Start=3015510>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3017300>30 years.
<SYNC Start=3018430>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3018883>And the greatest long game<br>
magic trick ever created.
<SYNC Start=3024592>Just to put me<br>
behind bars.
<SYNC Start=3026967>Okay.
<SYNC Start=3028337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3029925>So how did it feel,<br>
seeing me there?
<SYNC Start=3031875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3032842>Was it all you hoped?
<SYNC Start=3034682>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3034717>I don't know what<br>
you're talking about.
<SYNC Start=3035877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3035883>You're lying.
<SYNC Start=3037053>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3037967>It was an empty experience.
<SYNC Start=3040425>And you wanna know<br>
how I know?
<SYNC Start=3042505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3043550>I know because you know.
<SYNC Start=3046430>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3047592>There's always, always more
<SYNC Start=3050842>than what's on the surface.<br>
So what,
<SYNC Start=3052675>the past didn't happen,<br>
and you're not<br>
who I think you are?
<SYNC Start=3054295>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3054300>Now, don't tell me<br>
in 30 years
<SYNC Start=3055880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3055883>that's the first time you've<br>
asked yourself that question.
<SYNC Start=3058763>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3059425>I am not my father.
<SYNC Start=3060925>You're not getting<br>
in my head, okay?
<SYNC Start=3062755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3062758>You think you're<br>
luring me into a trap?<br>
You're not.
<SYNC Start=3065425>Now, I am desperate,<br>
which means I'm dangerous.
<SYNC Start=3068005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3068008>My only concern is<br>
the health and well-being<br>
of the horsemen.
<SYNC Start=3071628>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3071633>And you're gonna<br>
lead me to them.<br>
And if you don't,
<SYNC Start=3074425>I promise you,<br>
you're gonna end up<br>
far worse
<SYNC Start=3076425>than in some cushy<br>
jail cell somewhere.
<SYNC Start=3079005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3092550>What if the horsemen<br>
don't actually<br>
need you to save them?
<SYNC Start=3096050>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3100633>All right.<br>
So the lab is made up<br>
of two distinct layers,
<SYNC Start=3103342>the security perimeter
<SYNC Start=3104632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3104633>and the clean room.
<SYNC Start=3106633>The stick we're looking for<br>
should be in this core.
<SYNC Start=3108683>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3108717>So we're gonna have to<br>
get underneath, extract it,
<SYNC Start=3110717>and replace it with a decoy.
<SYNC Start=3112627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3112633>Luckily, it's similar<br>
in weight and size<br>
to a playing card,
<SYNC Start=3118592>so we're gonna have to<br>
brush up on our card-istry.
<SYNC Start=3120552>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3122550>Whoa, whoa!
<SYNC Start=3123680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3127967>That's no good.
<SYNC Start=3129337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3138717>So how do we get in?<br>
Hannes pike.
<SYNC Start=3140967>He's the son of<br>
a south African gangster.
<SYNC Start=3142837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3142842><i>He's rsvp'd with</i><br>
<i>what looks like</i>
<SYNC Start=3144800><i>a couple of members</i><br>
<i>of his security detail.</i>
<SYNC Start=3146680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3146717><i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,</i><br>
<i>and somebody named Buffy.</i>
<SYNC Start=3149717><i>Yeah, apparently,</i><br>
<i>he travels with a different</i><br>
<i>bimbo every week. Hmm.</i>
<SYNC Start=3153507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3153508>I wonder which one of us<br>
gets to play the bimbo.
<SYNC Start=3155548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3164717>Hey, can I get in?
<SYNC Start=3166677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3168425>At the soothing<br>
sound of the slots
<SYNC Start=3169925>you slip into a serene state<br>
of slumber and sleep.
<SYNC Start=3173505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3174842><i>They will think you're hannes,</i><br>
<i>so lead them out</i><br>
<i>and keep them busy.</i>
<SYNC Start=3179300>You trust your<br>
people implicitly.
<SYNC Start=3181508>You will have them<br>
take care of everything,
<SYNC Start=3183548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3183550>and you will wait<br>
in the car.
<SYNC Start=3184967>And eyes open,<br>
wide awake. Go.
<SYNC Start=3188677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3188717>Excuse me.<br>
These people<br>
are following me.
<SYNC Start=3190587>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3190592>You might wanna<br>
check their pockets.
<SYNC Start=3191842>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3195842><i>Then our time is</i><br>
<i>ticking to infiltrate the lab</i>
<SYNC Start=3197632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3197633><i>and get the card</i><br>
<i>to the market,</i>
<SYNC Start=3199013>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3199050><i>where I'll hand it off</i><br>
<i>to the eye,</i>
<SYNC Start=3200508><i>so we can all</i><br>
<i>get the hell home.</i>
<SYNC Start=3201508>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3220883>Ah! Hannes, my old friend.
<SYNC Start=3222717>So glad<br>
you could make it.
<SYNC Start=3224425>I knew you had<br>
a soft spot for<br>
an old-school bidding war.
<SYNC Start=3227545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3227550>How have you been?
<SYNC Start=3228680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3228717>I trust my people<br>
implicitly.
<SYNC Start=3230837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3230842>Certainly. But I'm sure<br>
you'd like to see<br>
it for yourself.
<SYNC Start=3235592>Hold it in your hands,<br>
check the build quality.
<SYNC Start=3238432>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3240717>Or not. Also fine.
<SYNC Start=3243425>Well, if you'd like<br>
to follow me.
<SYNC Start=3245505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3248883>You'll have to<br>
remove all your metal.
<SYNC Start=3251508>Watches, rings, etc.
<SYNC Start=3252717>Yeah, of course.
<SYNC Start=3253967>Excuse me for asking...
<SYNC Start=3255837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3255842>Where might i<br>
have seen you before?
<SYNC Start=3257762>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3258967>I don't know, probably<br>
one of my many symposiums.
<SYNC Start=3261507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3261508>The book jacket!
<SYNC Start=3262678>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3262717>I have to say,<br>
Dr. michaelakis,
<SYNC Start=3264337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3264383>I'm a huge fan.
<SYNC Start=3265592>Oh,<br>
thank you so much.
<SYNC Start=3267550>Uh, which book?<br>
There have been so many.
<SYNC Start=3271010>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3271050>Does hannes' chippy<br>
always talk for you, doctor?
<SYNC Start=3273880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3275717>Doctor?
<SYNC Start=3276757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3279508>Sorry, when you say "chippy,"<br>
you are referring<br>
to Buffy here, yeah?
<SYNC Start=3283338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3283342>Of course.
<SYNC Start=3284512>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3286425>Hannes prefers<br>
the term "floozy"
<SYNC Start=3288545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3288550>for all his boy toys.
<SYNC Start=3290840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3290842>Yeah. He does.<br>
That's good.<br>
Noted.
<SYNC Start=3293882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3293883>By the way,<br>
i got your email,<br>
Dr. michaelakis.
<SYNC Start=3296008>You had a query<br>
about our ability
<SYNC Start=3297628>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3297633>to maintain quantum coherence<br>
at room temperature
<SYNC Start=3299758>without the use of dilution,<br>
refrigerators,
<SYNC Start=3301678>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3301717>or error correction.
<SYNC Start=3304425>Do you care<br>
to elucidate?
<SYNC Start=3306005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3306050>Right.<br>
Yeah.
<SYNC Start=3307550>Yes, I did send that email.
<SYNC Start=3309550>The other day, I saw you.<br>
I did, I sent it.
<SYNC Start=3311340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3311383>So what gives?
<SYNC Start=3312592>I'm sorry, what gives...
<SYNC Start=3314012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3314050>I think what<br>
she's trying to say...
<SYNC Start=3315680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3315717>Actually, the grown-ups<br>
are having a meeting, Buffy.
<SYNC Start=3317717>Okay.
<SYNC Start=3319007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3319050>If you'll hold on to that.
<SYNC Start=3320467>Yeah, sure, doctor.<br>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=3322297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3322300>Now, every seventh grader,<br>
even the dumb ones,
<SYNC Start=3324717>know the second law<br>
of thermodynamics.
<SYNC Start=3326837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3326883>"All ordered systems<br>
tend toward disorder."
<SYNC Start=3328842>Disorder!
<SYNC Start=3330632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3330633>So I'm going to ask you one<br>
more time, sir, what gives?
<SYNC Start=3334513>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3340967>Well, it's actually<br>
topological quantum order.
<SYNC Start=3344337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3344342>The emergence of<br>
quantum effects<br>
on a macroscopic level.
<SYNC Start=3347425>So that is,<br>
in fact, what gives.
<SYNC Start=3350375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3355383>Thank you.
<SYNC Start=3356473>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3362842>You know,<br>
Buffy is not a bad<br>
name for you.
<SYNC Start=3366967>You know,<br>
buff, firm, taut.
<SYNC Start=3370677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3370717>That's good.<br>
Did you just find<br>
a thesaurus somewhere?
<SYNC Start=3372587>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3372592>Nubile.
<SYNC Start=3373882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3373883>- That's good.<br>
- Thank you. Okay.
<SYNC Start=3375633>There we go.
<SYNC Start=3377053>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3387383>Sorry, sorry.
<SYNC Start=3389053>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3396050>The stick's metal.<br>
How are we going<br>
to get it out?
<SYNC Start=3398508>Yeah. I don't know.
<SYNC Start=3399718>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3400842>This is the housing.
<SYNC Start=3402717>820 million qubit miles<br>
of digi-synaptic resonance.
<SYNC Start=3406757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3412717>But of course, what sets us<br>
apart from anything<br>
else on the planet
<SYNC Start=3415297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3415300>is the processor,
<SYNC Start=3416840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3416842>which we playfully refer to<br>
as the magic broomstick.
<SYNC Start=3419842>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3419883>The broomstick?
<SYNC Start=3420967>Has the power to<br>
clear the contents
<SYNC Start=3422425>of any computing<br>
system on the planet
<SYNC Start=3424755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3424758>and then magically<br>
sweep them into your bin.
<SYNC Start=3427548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3427550>Ah! Broomstick.<br>
That's funny.
<SYNC Start=3430300>Take a look,<br>
vet it however you'd like,
<SYNC Start=3432967>and tell hannes we'll be<br>
taking bids on Monday.
<SYNC Start=3435507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3435508>Thank you.
<SYNC Start=3436718>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3438717>Oh, my god.<br>
I must be allergic<br>
to something in here.
<SYNC Start=3441547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3441550>What could you possibly be<br>
allergic to in here?
<SYNC Start=3443340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3443342>This room is<br>
hermetically sealed.
<SYNC Start=3444382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3444883>That's it.
<SYNC Start=3446717>If we could get him away<br>
from the computer, please.
<SYNC Start=3450547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3450550>That's the one thing.
<SYNC Start=3451967>Just until<br>
he's recovered.
<SYNC Start=3453337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3453342>We're gonna need<br>
some anti-bacterial...
<SYNC Start=3454842>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3455883>Do we have<br>
alcohol wipes?
<SYNC Start=3457758>Your hands need to be<br>
sterile if you intend<br>
to get any closer.
<SYNC Start=3460298>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3460300>Do I make myself clear?
<SYNC Start=3462510>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3464008>Sorry. We couldn't...
<SYNC Start=3465588>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3465592>No, I'm fine.
<SYNC Start=3466882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3466883>...take his medicine<br>
into the country.
<SYNC Start=3468342>Yeah.
<SYNC Start=3469512>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3472842>Can't risk<br>
any contamination.
<SYNC Start=3475425>You're gonna have to stay away<br>
from the inner workings.
<SYNC Start=3478005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3478050>Thank you very much.<br>
Thank you.
<SYNC Start=3479550>All right.<br>
If you're done...<br>
Oh. Here you go.
<SYNC Start=3481340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3481342>Sorry about this.<br>
Okay. I'm okay.
<SYNC Start=3482967>This happens to him<br>
sometimes. It'll pass.<br>
Allergies.
<SYNC Start=3485007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3485050>Allergies.<br>
Nothing you can do.
<SYNC Start=3487340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3487342>Well, something<br>
you could do, doctor.
<SYNC Start=3489342>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3509342>Okay?
<SYNC Start=3510432>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3517425>Search him, please.
<SYNC Start=3518465>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3518467>Didn't we<br>
just do that?
<SYNC Start=3519837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3519883>Okay. I wanna run<br>
full diagnostics<br>
on the system.
<SYNC Start=3522843>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3525300>This is completely<br>
unnecessary.
<SYNC Start=3527050>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3556592>Up, up.
<SYNC Start=3557842>Okay.
<SYNC Start=3559012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3576967>Ah!
<SYNC Start=3579297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3579300>Hey! I can walk on my own.
<SYNC Start=3581680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3589050>Whoa!
<SYNC Start=3590800>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3592467>Sorry.
<SYNC Start=3593507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3611300>Hey!
<SYNC Start=3612425>I can do that myself.
<SYNC Start=3614425>We just met, man.
<SYNC Start=3616675>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3616717>Handsy, handsy, handsy.
<SYNC Start=3618007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3630342>Hey!
<SYNC Start=3631382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3632467>My eyes are up here, man.
<SYNC Start=3634967>How do you like it?
<SYNC Start=3636507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3658883>Hey, I'm good.
<SYNC Start=3660013>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3661717>Turn around.
<SYNC Start=3662757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3680842>Do you have anything?
<SYNC Start=3682300>I don't know.<br>
Can't trust anybody.
<SYNC Start=3683880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3685425>I'm good.
<SYNC Start=3686585>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3686592>They're clean.
<SYNC Start=3687682>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3689008>Do your final checks<br>
and get them out of here.
<SYNC Start=3691008>Oh, we're walking<br>
this way again. Yay.
<SYNC Start=3693508>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3698883>I don't speak<br>
the language.
<SYNC Start=3702633>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3708883>See?
<SYNC Start=3710425>What did I tell you, man?<br>
We didn't have anything.
<SYNC Start=3712335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3713342>Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.
<SYNC Start=3715802>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3731717>Something about<br>
a big white dance floor,
<SYNC Start=3734337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3734342>makes me wanna boogie.
<SYNC Start=3735550>Hey, thanks for having us.
<SYNC Start=3737010>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3738425>That's great stuff.
<SYNC Start=3740425>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3746425>You guys are pretty serious<br>
about your security, huh?
<SYNC Start=3750335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3753633>Okay.
<SYNC Start=3755343>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3755383>Do I have all my things?<br>
I feel like I came in
<SYNC Start=3757842>with more stuff.<br>
Did I come in<br>
with more stuff?
<SYNC Start=3759512>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3761550>You don't think so?
<SYNC Start=3762680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3765842>Uh, sir, I think you<br>
still have my wallet.
<SYNC Start=3768550>Remember, I, uh, gave it<br>
to you when I came in?
<SYNC Start=3771340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3771342>It would be nice<br>
to leave with it.
<SYNC Start=3773512>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3778300>Wallet coming through.
<SYNC Start=3779340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3786967>Sorry, my belt.
<SYNC Start=3788677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3794425>Uh...
<SYNC Start=3795875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3795883>I guess that's<br>
everything, right?
<SYNC Start=3797967>Thank you.
<SYNC Start=3799297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3799300>That is not a toy,<br>
Buffy.<br>
Sorry.
<SYNC Start=3801760>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3806883>Go, go, go!
<SYNC Start=3808633>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3815008>All right. Now,<br>
drop me off at the market
<SYNC Start=3816967>you asked me to call you when<br>
they started running around<br>
like headless chickens.
<SYNC Start=3822337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3823342>Well, that's<br>
what's happening.
<SYNC Start=3824682>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3839425>This is where your sources<br>
told you they'd be?
<SYNC Start=3841965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3841967>No, this is where<br>
my sources said<br>
we might find an answer.
<SYNC Start=3845877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3856967>She must be familiar<br>
with your work.
<SYNC Start=3858837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3858842>Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=3860467>Miss, have you seen<br>
these people?
<SYNC Start=3862797>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3874342>She says her grandson<br>
spoke to their leader.
<SYNC Start=3876682>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3876717>He's in the back.
<SYNC Start=3877877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3878592>What?
<SYNC Start=3879842>No "wow,<br>
you speak mandarin"?
<SYNC Start=3881802>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3913425>Ah! The coffin<br>
to the beyond.
<SYNC Start=3915585>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3916883>It was always a flap,
<SYNC Start=3919425>or a trap or mirrors.
<SYNC Start=3921625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3922717>The audience thought<br>
he'd just disappeared.
<SYNC Start=3925627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3927300>But he was always<br>
hidden somewhere inside.
<SYNC Start=3930300>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3941758>I believe that's<br>
the prototype for the one<br>
your father had made.
<SYNC Start=3946588>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3946592>He, like many others<br>
over the years,
<SYNC Start=3947842>ordered his supplies<br>
from here.
<SYNC Start=3949052>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3950633>Ah!
<SYNC Start=3952008>Of course.
<SYNC Start=3953838>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3953883>That's why<br>
you gave me the look
<SYNC Start=3955717>when I said<br>
they were in Macau.
<SYNC Start=3957675>Your father<br>
used to come here<br>
when you were young.
<SYNC Start=3959835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3959842>Can I please get<br>
some space here?
<SYNC Start=3961722>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3967008>You think you're<br>
the only one who'd<br>
wondered for 30 years
<SYNC Start=3969628>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3969633>what happened?
<SYNC Start=3971425>You're not.
<SYNC Start=3973005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3973050>Lionel was<br>
a master magician.
<SYNC Start=3975550>Either he gamed the hinges,
<SYNC Start=3977008>so he could kick the door<br>
and they would pop out,
<SYNC Start=3980678>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3980717>or he had access<br>
to the lock<br>
from the inside
<SYNC Start=3983297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3983300>so he could pick it.
<SYNC Start=3984590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3984592>Word is
<SYNC Start=3986300>the safe was made<br>
from cheap metal,<br>
and it bowed.
<SYNC Start=3989425>Still, he always had<br>
something up his sleeve.
<SYNC Start=3994965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3994967>Unless he'd<br>
reached the limit<br>
of his capabilities
<SYNC Start=3999007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3999050>and his clock ran out.
<SYNC Start=4001760>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4006425>Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=4008295>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4008300>My grandmother<br>
has something<br>
you might want.
<SYNC Start=4010630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4014758>This was your father's.
<SYNC Start=4016967>He had several<br>
of these made.
<SYNC Start=4019377>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4038633>And the horsemen?
<SYNC Start=4039683>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4041050>I overheard<br>
them talking.
<SYNC Start=4043425>One of them, atlas,<br>
he's meeting someone
<SYNC Start=4046335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4046383>at the market nearby.
<SYNC Start=4047843>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4065050>As for<br>
former agent rhodes,
<SYNC Start=4066758>his location is now<br>
your number one priority.
<SYNC Start=4069508>We're putting out<br>
an international apb.
<SYNC Start=4071678>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4071717>Including cooperation<br>
from local authorities.
<SYNC Start=4074007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4074050>Agent cowan.
<SYNC Start=4075840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4075842>I'm assuming it was<br>
actually not you
<SYNC Start=4077682>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4077717>who walked into<br>
newburgh federal prison,
<SYNC Start=4079507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4079508>then walked out<br>
30 minutes later<br>
with Thaddeus Bradley?
<SYNC Start=4082508>What?<br>
He used your ID.
<SYNC Start=4084508>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4088508>What are you doing,<br>
rhodes?
<SYNC Start=4090548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4117842>Atlas, hey.<br>
Dylan.
<SYNC Start=4119967>I blew it, I'm sorry.<br>
What are you doing here?
<SYNC Start=4121627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4121633>I'm here to help now.
<SYNC Start=4122843>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4122883>Okay, we definitely<br>
don't need your help.
<SYNC Start=4124383>I know I messed up,<br>
all right?
<SYNC Start=4125683>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4125717>Yeah, you put everybody's<br>
lives in danger.
<SYNC Start=4127297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4127300>Where is everybody?<br>
Where is everybody?
<SYNC Start=4129680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4129717>I can't be seen<br>
with you actually,<br>
right now.
<SYNC Start=4131425>I got it now, okay?<br>
I appreciate you taking
<SYNC Start=4133005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4133050>the time to take control<br>
for a little while.
<SYNC Start=4134340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4134383>Hey, I'm actually...<br>
Yeah?
<SYNC Start=4135550>Yeah, but I got it now,<br>
all right? Yeah.
<SYNC Start=4137300>You do?<br>
You look like you can<br>
get some rest, buddy.
<SYNC Start=4138967>Who you meeting here?
<SYNC Start=4140507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4140508>I'm not meeting anybody.
<SYNC Start=4141878>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4141883>They told me at iong's<br>
you were meeting somebody.
<SYNC Start=4143513>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4143550>At iong's?
<SYNC Start=4145510>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4145550>Okay, yeah,<br>
no, I am, um...
<SYNC Start=4147340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4148425>I'm meeting somebody<br>
from the eye.
<SYNC Start=4150835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4150842>To exchange<br>
this computer chip<br>
for our lives back.
<SYNC Start=4155342>I hope you're happy<br>
with the situation<br>
you've put us in.
<SYNC Start=4158508>You're talking<br>
to the eye?
<SYNC Start=4159967>Yeah.
<SYNC Start=4161297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4161300>Why are you talking<br>
to the eye?
<SYNC Start=4163010>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4163967>Atlas.
<SYNC Start=4165547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4165550>Atlas,<br>
give me the stick.
<SYNC Start=4166967>Dylan, you're not our<br>
leader anymore, okay?
<SYNC Start=4169507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4169508>You're not our hero.
<SYNC Start=4170838>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4170842>You're not FBI.
<SYNC Start=4172300>You're not<br>
a magician.
<SYNC Start=4173630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4173633>You're not<br>
really anything.
<SYNC Start=4175300>And we trusted you<br>
for a year.
<SYNC Start=4177967>So if you really<br>
wanna help us...
<SYNC Start=4180627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4180633>If you really<br>
wanna help us,<br>
you would leave.
<SYNC Start=4183383>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4191675>I get it. Cool.
<SYNC Start=4193835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4193842>Bye.
<SYNC Start=4194882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4212633>Yeah, that was me you called<br>
at the magic shop.
<SYNC Start=4216343>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4217300>So much fun though,
<SYNC Start=4218800>knowing you'd<br>
be scurrying away<br>
from me at the lab
<SYNC Start=4220340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4220342>just to bring it<br>
to me here.
<SYNC Start=4221632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4221633>Did you actually<br>
think I'd let you go?
<SYNC Start=4223508>How did you do that?
<SYNC Start=4224678>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4224717>Everyone has their button.
<SYNC Start=4226297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4226300>You push it<br>
and they go blind.
<SYNC Start=4227680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4227717>And yours,<br>
obviously, is ego.
<SYNC Start=4229757>&nbsp;

all the files,

<SYNC Start=4243300>but how do you think<br>
we were able to find him?
<SYNC Start=4245970>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4248967>I asked to see the face<br>
behind all of this.
<SYNC Start=4251007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4251050>What you actually<br>
put your phone on<br>

<SYNC Start=4272383>You really think<br>
I'm gonna walk away<br>
from you?

you just saw Dylan?

<SYNC Start=4441550>Dylan's here?<br>
What happened?
<SYNC Start=4443630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4443633>- Atlas.<br>
- I don't know.
<SYNC Start=4446053>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4450883>What are they doing?
<SYNC Start=4452300>Those are Walter's men.
<SYNC Start=4454680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4454717>This is what they want.
<SYNC Start=4457837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4457842>What the hell?<br>
How do you<br>
still have that?
<SYNC Start=4460052>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4464967>Whoa. That's<br>
Lionel shrike's safe.
<SYNC Start=4466837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4466842>What the hell<br>
do they want with that?
<SYNC Start=4469508>Okay, we gotta<br>
follow that truck.
<SYNC Start=4471338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4471342>They must have Dylan.<br>
We don't have much time.
<SYNC Start=4474682>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4478967>What do you want?
<SYNC Start=4480425>You to understand something<br>
very important.
<SYNC Start=4484005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4484967>We
<SYNC Start=4486627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4486633>are mirror images.
<SYNC Start=4488425>I share<br>
a very deep connection<br>
with my father.
<SYNC Start=4492005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4493467>And like you,<br>
I'll stop at nothing
<SYNC Start=4495967>to avenge any wrongs<br>
done to him.
<SYNC Start=4498467>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4502925>You know the only difference<br>
between your father and mine?
<SYNC Start=4506625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4506633>Mine's still alive.
<SYNC Start=4508593>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4509300>Get him up.
<SYNC Start=4510510>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4523842>So,
<SYNC Start=4525550>this is the man
<SYNC Start=4528380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4528383>who spent a lifetime<br>
plotting against me.
<SYNC Start=4531513>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4533508>I wouldn't have<br>
known your face
<SYNC Start=4535798>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4535800>if it had been on a billboard<br>
outside my bedroom window.
<SYNC Start=4539467>But you have spent,<br>
what, 30 years
<SYNC Start=4541677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4541717>thinking about mine?
<SYNC Start=4543047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4543050>When my father died,
<SYNC Start=4544680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4544717>your insurance company<br>
denied my mother her claims.
<SYNC Start=4546677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4546717>I wouldn't<br>
even have known...<br>
She died a pauper!
<SYNC Start=4548007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4548050>...who your mother was.
<SYNC Start=4549967>She was a digit,
<SYNC Start=4551007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4551050>a nanobyte<br>
in a stream of data.
<SYNC Start=4554680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4554717>Because nothing<br>
is personal to you
<SYNC Start=4556675>and everyone and everything<br>
is just a number,<br>
isn't that so?
<SYNC Start=4558925>That is where<br>
you are wrong,<br>
Mr. rhodes.
<SYNC Start=4561675>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4561717>Once you made yourself known<br>
it became very personal.
<SYNC Start=4566677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4567842>My son...<br>
Yeah, the sociopath.
<SYNC Start=4569758>Funny thing is,
<SYNC Start=4571298>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4571300>I have seven so-called<br>
legitimate children.
<SYNC Start=4574550>Sniveling, snobbish,
<SYNC Start=4576050>stupid runts.
<SYNC Start=4577967>I have one illegitimate child<br>
who is a lot like me.
<SYNC Start=4581547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4581550>The point is,<br>
he wants something,
<SYNC Start=4583925>and like any good parent,
<SYNC Start=4585625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4585633>I will stop at nothing
<SYNC Start=4588013>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4588050>to get it for him.
<SYNC Start=4589340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4589342>Your horsemen have it.
<SYNC Start=4591012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4591050>You will turn it and them
<SYNC Start=4593550>over to us, now.
<SYNC Start=4595508>No.
<SYNC Start=4596678>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4600383>Dylan, I would<br>
like you to really<br>
take this moment
<SYNC Start=4602967>because this is<br>
the consequence
<SYNC Start=4604677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4604717>of your personal<br>
vendetta come to life
<SYNC Start=4606675>and staring you<br>
in the face.
<SYNC Start=4608545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4608550>I want you to know<br>
that when you're gone,
<SYNC Start=4610300>we're gonna destroy<br>
everything you believe in,
<SYNC Start=4613675>starting with the horsemen,<br>
and ending with the eye.
<SYNC Start=4615835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4615842>Now then,<br>
cast your mind back
<SYNC Start=4617758>to standing by<br>
the banks of the river<br>
watching your father descend,
<SYNC Start=4620925>disgraced and discredited.
<SYNC Start=4622965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4622967>The horrid psychic pain<br>
as you have relived for years.
<SYNC Start=4625837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4626550>I felt that same thing
<SYNC Start=4628680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4628717>as you drained not<br>
just my father's fortune,
<SYNC Start=4631547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4631550>but his dignity!
<SYNC Start=4633630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4633633>And yet you took<br>
pleasure from it.
<SYNC Start=4635683>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4638508>This should bring back<br>
some childhood memories.
<SYNC Start=4641008>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4668467>Would you like<br>
some tea?<br>
Oh. Thank you.
<SYNC Start=4670427>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4685842>You ready?<br>
Over to you.
<SYNC Start=4688342>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4695342>Splash!
<SYNC Start=4696432>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4699800>Job done!
<SYNC Start=4701340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4716800>Hell is going<br>
to seem like<br>
a day at the spa
<SYNC Start=4719840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4719842>by the time we're through<br>
with these horsemen.
<SYNC Start=4722800>- Wouldn't you say?<br>
- You had me at "hell."
<SYNC Start=4725590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4742425><i>I love you so much.</i>
<SYNC Start=4744795>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4747383>Always keep something<br>
up my sleeve.
<SYNC Start=4749763>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4828550>I wish I could dredge<br>
from the muck of my soul
<SYNC Start=4831675>one speck of remorse,
<SYNC Start=4833835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4833842>but I can't.
<SYNC Start=4835800>So I'll stick to<br>
the business at hand
<SYNC Start=4839050>and try not to smile<br>
too broadly.
<SYNC Start=4841630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4842383>And, uh, thank you
<SYNC Start=4845300>for delivering<br>
Mr. Dylan rhodes.
<SYNC Start=4847680>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4848467>I take it it's done.
<SYNC Start=4850337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4851508>Literally hit<br>
the bottom.
<SYNC Start=4853548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4853967>Now,
<SYNC Start=4855007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4855967>where are the horsemen?
<SYNC Start=4857757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4857758>They're performers.
<SYNC Start=4859758>Their pride, their ego...
<SYNC Start=4862008>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4862050>Their need to be adored<br>
are all too powerful
<SYNC Start=4865508>to keep them out of<br>
the limelight for long.
<SYNC Start=4867425>If they don't make<br>
themselves known,
<SYNC Start=4870625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4870633>you will find yourself
<SYNC Start=4872925>in a very similar position
<SYNC Start=4875425>to Mr. rhodes.
<SYNC Start=4876965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4876967>Are we clear about that?
<SYNC Start=4878797>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4878800>As clear as the water<br>
he's under.
<SYNC Start=4880880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4888425>You'll have the rest
<SYNC Start=4890045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4890050>when I have the horsemen.
<SYNC Start=4891930>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4924008>Dylan!
<SYNC Start=4925338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4926633>Dylan, come on,<br>
buddy, breathe!
<SYNC Start=4928967>- Dylan.<br>
- Dylan?
<SYNC Start=4930425>Dylan, come on!
<SYNC Start=4932545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4936675>You're okay.
<SYNC Start=4939505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4939508>Jesus! You scared<br>
the hell out of us, man.
<SYNC Start=4942338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4942342>Are you all right, bro?
<SYNC Start=4943552>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4943842>Okay!
<SYNC Start=4945967>Thank you!<br>
This is the least<br>
i could do.
<SYNC Start=4947967>No. There's a hell of a lot<br>
less you could've done.
<SYNC Start=4949967>That was not an option.
<SYNC Start=4951467>You took a bullet<br>
for us, it was huge.
<SYNC Start=4953425>You really did, man.
<SYNC Start=4954715>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4957967>Thanks for<br>
pulling me out.<br>
Seriously.
<SYNC Start=4959757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4960675>Yeah.
<SYNC Start=4962005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4962008>You got yourself out.<br>
We did the easy part.
<SYNC Start=4964338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4964342>Literally, in my case,
<SYNC Start=4965967>I was just standing<br>
on the shore while<br>
atlas jumped down
<SYNC Start=4967337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4967342>and got you.
<SYNC Start=4968425>I'm serious.
<SYNC Start=4970005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4970050>Hey, you guys.<br>
Something's not right.
<SYNC Start=4971967>- What's wrong?<br>
- What?
<SYNC Start=4973427>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4975425>It's fake.
<SYNC Start=4976505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4976508>What?
<SYNC Start=4977758>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4979467>No, I had the stick.
<SYNC Start=4980967>The actual stick.<br>
I swear, it was in my hand.
<SYNC Start=4983047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4983050>In the lab.<br>
And then I put it in<br>
the little case thing.
<SYNC Start=4985675>And I gave it to atlas.
<SYNC Start=4986835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4986842>Is there any<br>
chance you've possibly<br>
misplaced it at any point?
<SYNC Start=4990842>I took it from you<br>
and then slipped it<br>
back in your coat
<SYNC Start=4994842>when I pushed you out.
<SYNC Start=4996842>Either way, we're<br>
left holding a whole<br>
sack full of nada.
<SYNC Start=4999675>Yeah, but they're gonna<br>
come after us as if<br>
we do have something.
<SYNC Start=5002425>No. Okay.<br>
I agree that somebody<br>
got the better of us.
<SYNC Start=5004675>But I don't agree<br>
that we have a sack<br>
full of nada.
<SYNC Start=5008375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5008383>Because we're all here.
<SYNC Start=5009592>That's a sack<br>
full of something.
<SYNC Start=5011592>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5012508>We all know that Walter<br>
is not going to stop<br>
until he gets that chip.
<SYNC Start=5019338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5019342>And we're the only ones that<br>
even know that he's alive.
<SYNC Start=5022842>We can't just walk away.
<SYNC Start=5025550>That's not what<br>
the horsemen do.
<SYNC Start=5027590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5030342>There's a quote. Um...
<SYNC Start=5032050>It's actually<br>
by the magician
<SYNC Start=5033675>that made me wanna do this<br>
in the first place.
<SYNC Start=5035465>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5035467>It's, uh...
<SYNC Start=5037467>"A magician's greatest power<br>
lies forever shrouded
<SYNC Start=5041797>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5041800>"in his empty fist."
<SYNC Start=5044050>"And the very idea<br>
that he can convince<br>
the world
<SYNC Start=5046590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5046592>"that he is, in fact,<br>
carrying with him a secret."
<SYNC Start=5049758>That's Lionel shrike.
<SYNC Start=5051425>Right.
<SYNC Start=5052505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5053842>That we should pretend like<br>
we have something we don't?
<SYNC Start=5057762>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5061383>What is Walter's<br>
greatest fear?
<SYNC Start=5062883>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5063508>Being seen.
<SYNC Start=5065338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5065342>And what does<br>
the stick do?
<SYNC Start=5066550>The stick can<br>
unencode anything.
<SYNC Start=5068840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5068842>It can open up a back door<br>
into any computer
<SYNC Start=5072300>on the planet.
<SYNC Start=5073840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5073842>Including his.<br>
Yeah.
<SYNC Start=5075682>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5077550>Right, we not only make him<br>
think that we have it,
<SYNC Start=5079967>but that we're going to use it<br>
to expose and destroy him.
<SYNC Start=5084297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5084300>We need a plan.
<SYNC Start=5085425>But we don't have time.
<SYNC Start=5087675>We have each other and<br>
there are five of us.
<SYNC Start=5091295>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5091300>But we also<br>
need supplies, right?<br>
And resources.
<SYNC Start=5094340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5094342>And probably more<br>
than five people.
<SYNC Start=5097550>Do you really think<br>
you don't have help?
<SYNC Start=5101508>Oh, she speaks English.<br>
Of course. Yeah.
<SYNC Start=5104378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5104383>Do you know why<br>
the fool is the most<br>
powerful card in the tarot?
<SYNC Start=5109800>Not because the person<br>
who draws him is a fool.
<SYNC Start=5113550>He's a fool
<SYNC Start=5115050>because he's a clean slate,
<SYNC Start=5117967>and, therefore, can become
<SYNC Start=5120507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5120508>anything.
<SYNC Start=5121967>You were chosen.
<SYNC Start=5123467>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5124008>All of you.
<SYNC Start=5125925>Not because of<br>
who you are,
<SYNC Start=5128505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5128508>but because of who<br>
you might become.
<SYNC Start=5131338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5132800>When you say "chosen"...
<SYNC Start=5134008>Are you part of<br>
the eye?
<SYNC Start=5136675>Yes.
<SYNC Start=5137835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5137842>We are part of<br>
the eye.
<SYNC Start=5140842>You've each<br>
doubted our existence.
<SYNC Start=5144052>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5144842>Wondering
<SYNC Start=5146717>if we, indeed,<br>
were watching.
<SYNC Start=5149337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5152842>We are.
<SYNC Start=5154382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5154383>We always have been.
<SYNC Start=5156508>This is the best<br>
magic shop in the world.
<SYNC Start=5159008>You know what<br>
she's saying, right?
<SYNC Start=5160298>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5160300>Yes.
<SYNC Start=5161425>That now we have<br>
resources and help.
<SYNC Start=5163755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5165592>Thank you.
<SYNC Start=5166932>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5169425>So, who's in?
<SYNC Start=5171045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5174842>I'm in.
<SYNC Start=5176300>Yeah, I'm in.
<SYNC Start=5177590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5180383>Let's do this.
<SYNC Start=5181473>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5198967>No, no, no.

<SYNC Start=5315050>Dad, who do we have<br>
security-wise on this?<br>
Your guys?
<SYNC Start=5317590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5317592>Well, we want all of them<br>
and all their friends.
<SYNC Start=5320425>Stationed throughout the city,<br>
so they can be anywhere<br>
in 60 seconds.
<SYNC Start=5324795>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5338925>Hello! Hey!
<SYNC Start=5341375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5343300>My name's Jack Wilder.
<SYNC Start=5345800>Goddamn,<br>
it feels good<br>
to be back.
<SYNC Start=5347840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5347842>All right,<br>
gather around.
<SYNC Start=5350342>I wanna talk to you about<br>
something real quick.
<SYNC Start=5354300>You all know three card monte,<br>
also known as "find the lady"?
<SYNC Start=5357758>Trick performed by street<br>
hustlers all over the world.<br>
And why street hustlers?
<SYNC Start=5362048>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5362050>Because as soon as you walk up<br>
to the table, you lose.
<SYNC Start=5364675>Every time.<br>
Let me demonstrate.
<SYNC Start=5366795>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5367883>While we're at it,<br>
let's find ourselves<br>
a life-sized queen.
<SYNC Start=5373717>Ma'am, would you<br>
mind being my queen?
<SYNC Start=5375757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5378967>Don't worry.<br>
I promise you
<SYNC Start=5380925>there's a 50% chance<br>
you'll get her back<br>
after the show.
<SYNC Start=5382795>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5382800>Head over there.<br>
Thank you very much.
<SYNC Start=5384675>All right. Let's find<br>
ourselves some Jacks<br>
to serve our queen!
<SYNC Start=5388335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5388342><i>Trust me, gentlemen.</i>
<SYNC Start=5389632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5389633>I know how<br>
these guys work now.
<SYNC Start=5391842>They're gonna start<br>
with a tease.
<SYNC Start=5393508>A few little pop-ups.
<SYNC Start=5395548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5395550><i>Something to</i><br>
<i>lure you in. Like...</i>
<SYNC Start=5398508>Well, you know...<br>
Like three card monte,<br>
where the guy goes,
<SYNC Start=5402675>"looky here,<br>
but no, no, looky here!"
<SYNC Start=5405375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5405383><i>Except when all these</i><br>
<i>little tricks are done,</i>
<SYNC Start=5409383><i>the only thing</i><br>
<i>you're gonna be looking at</i>
<SYNC Start=5411508>is the inside of your own<br>
colon, with the words
<SYNC Start=5415588>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5415592><i>"horsemen"</i><br>
<i>written all over it.</i>
<SYNC Start=5418592>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5419342>In blood.
<SYNC Start=5420842>We get the picture,<br>
Mr. mckinney.
<SYNC Start=5424467>And get out<br>
of my chair.
<SYNC Start=5426837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5426842><i>Hello, everybody!</i>
<SYNC Start=5428800><i>Come close, come on!</i>
<SYNC Start=5430840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5430842>All right,<br>
all right, so listen.
<SYNC Start=5432842>Tonight, I am going<br>
to make something fly
<SYNC Start=5436632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5436633>using actual magic.
<SYNC Start=5438467>- Are you ready?<br>
- Yeah!
<SYNC Start=5440337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5440342>I'm going to take<br>
a very large vessel,
<SYNC Start=5443425>I'm gonna make<br>
it fly over there<br>
and land on the thames.
<SYNC Start=5447675>Can you handle that?
<SYNC Start=5449675>Same rules<br>
apply as before.
<SYNC Start=5451375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5451383>All you need to do is<br>
keep your eye on the queen.
<SYNC Start=5453508>It's as simple as that.
<SYNC Start=5454838>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5454842>- Are you guys ready?<br>
- Yeah!
<SYNC Start=5456675>Dad, look at this.
<SYNC Start=5459505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5459508>Near the river. Looks like<br>
the shows are starting.
<SYNC Start=5462675>But we're not the only ones<br>
who found them.
<SYNC Start=5464675>What do you mean?<br>
It's on channel one.
<SYNC Start=5466375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5474550>- Let's go to 2.<br>
- Here we go.
<SYNC Start=5475840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5475842>Got him.<br>
We have a location.
<SYNC Start=5478550>It's Jack Wilder.<br>
Here come the horsemen.
<SYNC Start=5480550>Okay, we're moving.<br>
Let's go, let's go.
<SYNC Start=5482590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5486008>Turn around.<br>
Hide yourselves<br>
with the cards.
<SYNC Start=5488758>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5489425>And here we go.
<SYNC Start=5491545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5493967>You guys still<br>
have your eye on her?
<SYNC Start=5495377>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5495383>You want me to<br>
go back and do it?
<SYNC Start=5496383>Okay, all right.<br>
I'm moving on.
<SYNC Start=5497842>And switch.
<SYNC Start=5499512>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5501425>Where is she?
<SYNC Start=5502505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5503717>Down at the end?<br>
You sure?
<SYNC Start=5505837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5505842>All right,<br>
can I get a drumroll<br>
from my man in the back?
<SYNC Start=5508717>Thank you very much.
<SYNC Start=5510337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5511842>Uh-oh.
<SYNC Start=5513512>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5514300>Uh-oh.
<SYNC Start=5515340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5516550>There's my girl.
<SYNC Start=5519008>Not my girl.<br>
100% your girl.
<SYNC Start=5521508>But just<br>
in this situation.
<SYNC Start=5523298>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5523300>Okay, but I gotta warm up<br>
a little bit first. Okay?
<SYNC Start=5525840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5525842>So, uh, let me just<br>
make something small<br>
fly, like...
<SYNC Start=5529842>Fly, fly, fly!
<SYNC Start=5531967>Wow, right?<br>
Look at that!
<SYNC Start=5533797>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5533800>Aw. Come on, people.
<SYNC Start=5535590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5535592>Tough crowd. You, fly!
<SYNC Start=5538550>Me?<br>
Check your fly.
<SYNC Start=5539760>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5542550>You like that?
<SYNC Start=5544840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5544842>You support<br>
that relationship?
<SYNC Start=5546842>That guy had<br>
a bird in his pants.<br>
That's disgusting.
<SYNC Start=5549802>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5553467><i>Copy that. We've got</i><br>
<i>two sightings reported.</i>
<SYNC Start=5555547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5555550><i>Heading to greenwich market.</i><br>
<i>Get me Thaddeus.</i>
<SYNC Start=5558550><i>Thaddeus, the FBI are here.</i><br>
<i>They're moving.</i>
<SYNC Start=5560840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5560842><i>Let 'em move.</i>
<SYNC Start=5562592>Well, what if they<br>
get there first?<br>
That can't happen.
<SYNC Start=5565800><i>I guarantee you, they won't.</i>
<SYNC Start=5567967>Find the pattern.
<SYNC Start=5569377>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5570300>You do that,
<SYNC Start=5571590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5571592>and you'll be able<br>
to cut them off
<SYNC Start=5573675><i>before they get to</i><br>
<i>their final trick.</i>
<SYNC Start=5575675>If it makes you feel better,
<SYNC Start=5577335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5577342>I'll take care of the FBI.
<SYNC Start=5579512>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5593675>I guess you found me!
<SYNC Start=5595295>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5595300>We've got a third spot.
<SYNC Start=5596800>Okay, everybody,<br>
we're getting a pattern.
<SYNC Start=5599470>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5601675>Um... give me 2,
<SYNC Start=5603675>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5604925>13 and 21.
<SYNC Start=5606795>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5607842>What the hell is that?
<SYNC Start=5608882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5609675>Freeze that and zoom in.
<SYNC Start=5610755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5612800>How the hell<br>
did this happen?
<SYNC Start=5615675>He's dead.<br>
We watched him drown.<br>
How the hell did this happen?
<SYNC Start=5618875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5618883>Given that it did happen,<br>
the pertinent question is,
<SYNC Start=5621300>what are we<br>
gonna do about it?
<SYNC Start=5622550>We're gonna stop him, dad.<br>
We'll stop him.
<SYNC Start=5623967>Where's my coat?
<SYNC Start=5625627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5625633>Walter, for the record,<br>
i never loved the safe idea.
<SYNC Start=5628467>Oh, I know<br>
where they're going.
<SYNC Start=5629967>The next show is merritt's<br>
and it's by the river.
<SYNC Start=5632675>So we can find the horsemen's<br>
entry point for the finale.
<SYNC Start=5636295>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5641842><i>I've a confession to make.</i>
<SYNC Start=5643425>I've been told I have<br>
some control issues.
<SYNC Start=5645675>I've learned that it's really,<br>
really hard to control people,
<SYNC Start=5649005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5649008>so I'm gonna try<br>
to control something
<SYNC Start=5651008>that's a lot<br>
easier than people.
<SYNC Start=5653008>I'm gonna try to<br>
control the weather.
<SYNC Start=5654548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5654550>Yeah, rain, um...
<SYNC Start=5656720>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5658842>It'd be a little difficult<br>
to make it rain, right?
<SYNC Start=5660592>That would be something<br>
that only god can do, right?
<SYNC Start=5663508>I'm gonna do something<br>
that god can't do.
<SYNC Start=5665798>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5665800>I'm not just gonna<br>
make it clear up.<br>
No, no, no.
<SYNC Start=5668717>I'm gonna make<br>
it actually stop.
<SYNC Start=5670877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5684050>And can god do that?
<SYNC Start=5685467>Mmm. No, I don't think so.
<SYNC Start=5687467>Or what about make it go up?
<SYNC Start=5689797>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5697467><i>Are you still with me?</i>
<SYNC Start=5699507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5699508>Watch the queen on the left.<br>
Let's do it.
<SYNC Start=5701425>Turn around.
<SYNC Start=5702625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5705842>Switch!
<SYNC Start=5707012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5710717>Show me the lady.
<SYNC Start=5711925>Show me the lady!
<SYNC Start=5714835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5714842>The end? End?
<SYNC Start=5716012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5718550>You know what?<br>
I'm actually starting<br>
to feel kinda bad.
<SYNC Start=5720630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5721675>It's just because<br>
i can actually feel
<SYNC Start=5723335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5723342>that you guys are<br>
paying attention.
<SYNC Start=5724800>You know, it's unfortunate<br>
that it's the wrong<br>
kind of attention.
<SYNC Start=5729300>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5731300>Yeah, we need a fresher bird.
<SYNC Start=5733720>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5734842>He's so cute. He's so cute!
<SYNC Start=5738008>Let's kill him, right?
<SYNC Start=5740838>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5740842>Merritt,<br>
move into position.
<SYNC Start=5742925>Got it, Dylan.
<SYNC Start=5744875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5744883>Uh, I'm on my way.<br>
I'll see you there.
<SYNC Start=5746675>Lula, stand by, all right?
<SYNC Start=5749045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5749050>Or, what about just go,<br>

<SYNC Start=6042382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6043550>That is, if they're gonna<br>
get here by midnight.
<SYNC Start=6046010>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6055008>Ah!
<SYNC Start=6056508>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6058342>Okay, feeling fear.
<SYNC Start=6060012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6060925>Fear.
<SYNC Start=6062045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6062050>Anger, anger.
<SYNC Start=6063340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6064425>Oh, full house!
<SYNC Start=6065755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6065758>That's enough.
<SYNC Start=6067508>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6068925>I was done.
<SYNC Start=6070505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6071383>So nice to see you all again.
<SYNC Start=6075508>But since we're<br>
such old friends,
<SYNC Start=6078628>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6078633>let's skip the formalities.
<SYNC Start=6081013>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6081925>One of you
<SYNC Start=6083545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6083550>has something we require.
<SYNC Start=6086800>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6088467>So give it over.
<SYNC Start=6090007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6098425>Nothing at all?
<SYNC Start=6100625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6101758>Really?
<SYNC Start=6102838>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6105967>Sit down!
<SYNC Start=6107927>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6114550>Let's go, let's go!
<SYNC Start=6116010>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6117300>Hurry up and move them quickly<br>
before they can do anything.
<SYNC Start=6121340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6121342>Get those lights off me!
<SYNC Start=6122592>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6128342>Get on the plane!
<SYNC Start=6129842>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6131842>Ow! Hey!
<SYNC Start=6134012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6136633>Get on the plane!
<SYNC Start=6137683>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6147342>Hey!<br>
Whoa, whoa, hey!
<SYNC Start=6148632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6148633>Yeah, uh,<br>
take off immediately.
<SYNC Start=6150633>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6153842>You know, you make it<br>
almost too easy?
<SYNC Start=6156632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6156633>I mean,<br>
even your hilarious attempts
<SYNC Start=6158508>to make<br>
yourselves unpredictable,
<SYNC Start=6160425>just follow<br>
the same pattern<br>
each time.
<SYNC Start=6162375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6162383>Set up, set up, set up.
<SYNC Start=6164425>Which tonight was going<br>
to be stroke of midnight,
<SYNC Start=6168295>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6168300>middle of the thames?<br>
Tell me if I'm warm.
<SYNC Start=6170880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6175717>Well, there will be<br>
a big reveal, and<br>
it will come now.
<SYNC Start=6179627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6181383>The stick, dear boy.
<SYNC Start=6183763>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6184925>- No.<br>
- Fine.
<SYNC Start=6186335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6186800>Start with her.
<SYNC Start=6189008>Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!
<SYNC Start=6191508>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6193633>Give it to him.<br>
Danny, give him the card.
<SYNC Start=6197008>- Just give it to him.<br>
- Danny, come on.
<SYNC Start=6198878>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6208883>We'll have a closer look.
<SYNC Start=6210013>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6218592>Okay, I owe you an apology.
<SYNC Start=6220632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6220633>Leader, you should have<br>
planned an escape, okay?
<SYNC Start=6222467>This is the both of us.<br>
Okay, it's the both of us.
<SYNC Start=6224627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6224633>Guys, come on!<br>
Come on, stop!
<SYNC Start=6226300>You, to save your<br>
little girlfriend!
<SYNC Start=6228008>To save my...<br>
He had a knife<br>
to her head!
<SYNC Start=6230008>I'm a horseman, you dick!
<SYNC Start=6231508>All right, you know what?<br>
This is not the time!
<SYNC Start=6232798>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6232800>And you,<br>
what's your deal, man?
<SYNC Start=6234380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6234383>Look, they're not<br>
gonna get blood
<SYNC Start=6235633>they're probably gonna<br>
throw us out of the plane.
<SYNC Start=6237967>Really?<br>
I'm sorry to interrupt,
<SYNC Start=6239675>but I just have to<br>
say congratulations.
<SYNC Start=6241835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6241842>And thank you!
<SYNC Start=6243052>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6244675>It's real.
<SYNC Start=6245875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6245883>What?
<SYNC Start=6247508>It's real?
<SYNC Start=6248968>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6250675>Bring them through.
<SYNC Start=6251755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6251758>Did you say it's real?
<SYNC Start=6252925>What is<br>
he talking about?
<SYNC Start=6253965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6253967>Move!
<SYNC Start=6255377>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6255383>Well done, my boy.
<SYNC Start=6256843>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6260717>Cote du marisule champagne.
<SYNC Start=6263337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6263342>It's the most<br>
expensive bottle
<SYNC Start=6265967>on earth.
<SYNC Start=6267467>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6268342>$1.2 million.
<SYNC Start=6270508>And I saved it just<br>
for this occasion.
<SYNC Start=6274548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6274550>Honestly, same bottle,<br>
liquor shack, 700k.
<SYNC Start=6278380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6278842>Hey.
<SYNC Start=6280632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6280633>You got what you wanted.
<SYNC Start=6281967>So, does this mean<br>
you're letting us go?
<SYNC Start=6284675>Knowing what you<br>
know about us? No.
<SYNC Start=6287675>You sure?
<SYNC Start=6288835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6288842>Chase, what shall we do?
<SYNC Start=6290842>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6293008>Toss them out.
<SYNC Start=6295378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6295383>Get your last words<br>
in quickly, everybody!
<SYNC Start=6297633>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6299842>No! Come on! No!
<SYNC Start=6301842>Farewell.
<SYNC Start=6302882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6303675>Oh, god! No!
<SYNC Start=6305875>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6307050>Wait! I just wanna say.
<SYNC Start=6309590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6309592>I came into the world<br>
with the wrong family,
<SYNC Start=6311842>but I'm leaving<br>
with the right one.
<SYNC Start=6313925>I love you guys!
<SYNC Start=6315625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6315633>No!<br>
No, no, no!
<SYNC Start=6316723>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6318508>This is how I kicked<br>
you out of the womb.
<SYNC Start=6320925>No!
<SYNC Start=6322045>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6323633>Who's next?
<SYNC Start=6324933>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6331008>No, wait! Let me go!
<SYNC Start=6332967>Let go of me!
<SYNC Start=6335467>No, no, no!
<SYNC Start=6336877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6337800>Let me go!<br>
Toss her!
<SYNC Start=6339340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6343633>Oh, god!
<SYNC Start=6344883>Hurry up and<br>
shut that door!
<SYNC Start=6346342>It's getting<br>
cold in here.
<SYNC Start=6347967>Okay, hit the road, Jack!
<SYNC Start=6349967>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6355508>No, no, no!
<SYNC Start=6356678>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6357967>A lot of brain,<br>
but not enough brawn.
<SYNC Start=6360427>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6364008>Oh, that was fun!
<SYNC Start=6365048>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6367883>Cheers!
<SYNC Start=6369550>Well done, my boy.
<SYNC Start=6370970>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6375508>Um...
<SYNC Start=6376838>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6376842>No, is it supposed<br>
to taste like that?
<SYNC Start=6379050>No, it is not.
<SYNC Start=6380720>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6400508>What the hell<br>
is going on?
<SYNC Start=6402008>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6411967>Okay,<br>
come pick them up!
<SYNC Start=6413677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6414842>- Come on.<br>
- Come on out.
<SYNC Start=6416682>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6429925><i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
<SYNC Start=6431625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6431633><i>The horsemen!</i>
<SYNC Start=6433843>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6454008><i>No, you should feel pretty</i><br>

<SYNC Start=6468925>We are moving now.<br>
The whole thing just changed.
<SYNC Start=6471675>All backup into position stat!<br>
We're on the move.
<SYNC Start=6474505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6475842>You're staying here!
<SYNC Start=6476967>Of course.
<SYNC Start=6478007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6485425>Move! Move!<br>
Out of the way!
<SYNC Start=6487465>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6487467><i>Wow!</i><br>
<i>Thank you very much, London!</i>
<SYNC Start=6489675><i>We would like to acknowledge</i><br>
<i>not just our old friend</i>
<SYNC Start=6492585>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6492592><i>but his young and very</i><br>
<i>brilliant son, Walter mabry.</i>
<SYNC Start=6496675><i>Who has performed one of the</i><br>

<SYNC Start=6499335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6499342><i>even we have ever seen.</i>
<SYNC Start=6500882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6500883><i>He has, amazingly, brought</i><br>
<i>himself back from the dead!</i>
<SYNC Start=6505300><i>But before he did that,</i>
<SYNC Start=6507880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6507883><i>he revealed someone.</i>
<SYNC Start=6509425><i>And we think it</i><br>
<i>only right to give him</i>
<SYNC Start=6512335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6512342><i>a proper introduction.</i>
<SYNC Start=6514592><i>He is our friend</i><br>

<SYNC Start=6517467><i>Dylan shrike!</i>
<SYNC Start=6518675><i>- Get over here!</i><br>
<i>- Yeah!</i>
<SYNC Start=6520675>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6526550><i>So, normally</i>

<SYNC Start=6533505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6533508><i>know the secret</i><br>

<SYNC Start=6535675><i>But tonight,</i><br>

<SYNC Start=6538755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6538758><i>all of you people</i><br>
<i>around the thames here.</i>
<SYNC Start=6541878>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=6543967><i>everyone around the world</i>
<SYNC Start=6546675><i>already knows everything.</i>
<SYNC Start=6549335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6549342><i>And only these fellows</i><br>
<i>here are the ones</i><br>
<i>left in the dark.</i>
<SYNC Start=6553467><i>So let's see how closely</i><br>
<i>you were watching our shows.</i>
<SYNC Start=6556467><i>Remember when we were</i><br>
<i>playing "find the lady."</i>
<SYNC Start=6559587>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6559592><i>I said that we</i><br>
<i>used a Barry trap.</i>
<SYNC Start=6561682>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6562842><i>Some classic switches</i><br>
<i>and a few duplicates?</i>
<SYNC Start=6566592><i>Well, that's how we switched</i><br>
<i>the driver of the truck.</i>
<SYNC Start=6570052>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6573050><i>Which took us to</i><br>
<i>a duplicate hangar</i>
<SYNC Start=6575467><i>where we used</i><br>
<i>your need to rush,</i>
<SYNC Start=6577757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6577758><i>and your fear of being seen</i><br>
<i>let you do the work for us.</i>
<SYNC Start=6581338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6581342><i>Get those lights off me!</i>
<SYNC Start=6582632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6584383><i>So, the airplane.</i>
<SYNC Start=6586467><i>How did we get it to fly?</i>
<SYNC Start=6588047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6589675><i>Well, we used fans,</i>
<SYNC Start=6591675><i>and lights and rain machines.</i>
<SYNC Start=6594545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6599675><i>Obviously, all of this was</i><br>
<i>reliant on us getting caught.</i>
<SYNC Start=6604465>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6604467><i>That you would do exactly</i><br>
<i>what we needed you to do</i>
<SYNC Start=6607877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6607883><i>once you did catch us.</i>
<SYNC Start=6609508><i>My brother chase,</i>
<SYNC Start=6611378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6611383><i>who was technical adviser</i><br>
<i>to the losing team.</i>
<SYNC Start=6615675><i>He taught us that it's</i><br>
<i>all about blind spots.</i>
<SYNC Start=6618465>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6618467>I know where you're going!
<SYNC Start=6620007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6620008><i>And, uh, surprises.</i>
<SYNC Start=6623718>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6625508>Watch it, hobo.
<SYNC Start=6626967>Why don't you watch<br>
the watch I'm wearing,
<SYNC Start=6628717>the where of where<br>
you're watching, and sleep!
<SYNC Start=6631587>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6631592>It's going to be your idea<br>
to throw the horsemen
<SYNC Start=6633632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6633633>out of the plane.
<SYNC Start=6634967>If all of this is<br>
kind of confusing to you,
<SYNC Start=6637297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6637300>I can maybe catch<br>
you up on it later.
<SYNC Start=6639590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6639592>Probably see you what,<br>
three to five?
<SYNC Start=6642012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6643050>Come on, put it there.
<SYNC Start=6645300>Hey! Tit for tat, bro!
<SYNC Start=6646760>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6648008><i>Basically,</i><br>

<i>to adjust markets,</i>

<SYNC Start=6925758>Your father and i<br>
were partners.
<SYNC Start=6928628>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6928633>Our act was<br>
that of rivals.
<SYNC Start=6931803>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6932883>I was the<br>
hard-eyed realist.
<SYNC Start=6935842>He was the<br>
dreamy-eyed idealist.
<SYNC Start=6938675>We thought it was<br>
the perfect misdirect.
<SYNC Start=6941505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6942508>Yes, in public,<br>
i did goad him.
<SYNC Start=6946338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6946342>The only thing<br>
we didn't count on
<SYNC Start=6948302>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6949050>was it going so wrong.
<SYNC Start=6950930>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6954967>Why?
<SYNC Start=6956837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6956842>Why didn't you ever<br>
say anything to me?
<SYNC Start=6958758>I don't know.
<SYNC Start=6960428>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6961467>Give it a name.
<SYNC Start=6962797>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6962800>Shame, guilt.
<SYNC Start=6964840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6964842>Regret.
<SYNC Start=6966342>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6969925>Hey, guys, uh,<br>
you might wanna come<br>
take a look at this.
<SYNC Start=6972925>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6974633>Hmm.
<SYNC Start=6975723>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6977050>Look.
<SYNC Start=6978508><i>I put you</i><br>
<i>in jail, man.</i>
<SYNC Start=6980338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6980342>Why didn't you<br>
say something then?
<SYNC Start=6982717>Well, you know,<br>
i was going to.
<SYNC Start=6985837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6985842>But then, you were<br>
so quick to show your<br>
personal motivations that...
<SYNC Start=6989842>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6991717>Well, quite frankly
<SYNC Start=6993507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6993508>it spoiled<br>
the trick for me.
<SYNC Start=6995298>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6995300>I showed my weakness.
<SYNC Start=6996630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6996633>Well, it showed<br>
you weren't ready.
<SYNC Start=6999508>But when you came<br>
back to my cell,
<SYNC Start=7002298>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7002300>you had let go of your<br>
30-year vendetta against me
<SYNC Start=7006340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7007592>for your horsemen.
<SYNC Start=7008972>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7010633><i>And I said to myself,</i>
<SYNC Start=7013342><i>"that's Lionel's boy."</i>
<SYNC Start=7015432>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7016050><i>And I knew it was my job</i>
<SYNC Start=7018675><i>to see to it that</i><br>
<i>he became the magician</i><br>
<i>he was born to be.</i>
<SYNC Start=7023505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7023508>All that was<br>
left then was...
<SYNC Start=7025838>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7027633>For me to hit bottom.
<SYNC Start=7028883>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7029675>So the safe,
<SYNC Start=7030965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7030967>my father's wristwatch,
<SYNC Start=7032925>that was all you?
<SYNC Start=7034585>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7037342><i>Walter and tressler,</i><br>
<i>were they in on it too?</i>
<SYNC Start=7040675><i>Oh, we knew</i><br>
<i>Walter was in hiding.</i>
<SYNC Start=7043625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7043633><i>The octa show was a setup</i><br>
<i>to expose him to the public.</i>
<SYNC Start=7047473>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7050633><i>And you were right</i><br>
<i>about the horsemen.</i>
<SYNC Start=7052758><i>They needed to learn</i><br>
<i>to work together like</i><br>
<i>a single organism.</i>
<SYNC Start=7057678>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7065383>Now I know why<br>
you look so familiar.
<SYNC Start=7067967>You're the horsemen,<br>
aren't you?
<SYNC Start=7069547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7077342><i>But that can't be</i><br>
<i>what all this is about.</i>
<SYNC Start=7080967>You know,<br>
the best tricks
<SYNC Start=7082967>work on many levels.
<SYNC Start=7085507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7085508>And the deepest one,
<SYNC Start=7087425>for me, at least,
<SYNC Start=7089545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7089550>is this moment<br>
right here.
<SYNC Start=7092430>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7095842>I'm sorry, Dylan.
<SYNC Start=7097512>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7098008>I miss your father.
<SYNC Start=7100675>30 years is a long time<br>
to drag something<br>
around, isn't it?
<SYNC Start=7104375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7104383>Yes, it is.
<SYNC Start=7105973>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7115842>So, now what?
<SYNC Start=7117342>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7119633>Now I'm about<br>
out of moves.<br>
Oh...
<SYNC Start=7122592>Come on, you're the one<br>
who said that you<br>
believe that this road
<SYNC Start=7126425>lead to the great wizard<br>
behind the curtain.
<SYNC Start=7128335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7128342>And that you'd finally<br>
get to look him in the eyes.
<SYNC Start=7132592>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7133008>I am.
<SYNC Start=7134758>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7140550>It's your game now.
<SYNC Start=7143008>You play it however<br>
you see fit.
<SYNC Start=7145758>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7146883>My suggestion, however,
<SYNC Start=7149342>is that you find<br>
yourself a successor.
<SYNC Start=7152842>Hi. Okay, so, um...
<SYNC Start=7154800>Well, obviously,<br>
we have a few questions.
<SYNC Start=7156967>Right?
<SYNC Start=7158925>Uh... by "a few,"<br>
i think he means,<br>
like, five million.
<SYNC Start=7160755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7160758>Yeah.<br>
Well.
<SYNC Start=7162467>Good luck to you all.
<SYNC Start=7164377>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7164383>What!<br>
Okay. See,<br>
that's not fair.
<SYNC Start=7165967>Come on.<br>
That's not right.
<SYNC Start=7167297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7167300>That's gonna make<br>
me really angry!
<SYNC Start=7168550>Not right now.
<SYNC Start=7169800>Oh, um,<br>
by the way...
<SYNC Start=7171550>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7173675>Pay no attention<br>
to the curtain.
<SYNC Start=7176335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7179008>There is a curtain.
<SYNC Start=7180508>Go, go, go.
<SYNC Start=7181878>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7191300><i>Seeing is believing.</i>
<SYNC Start=7193840>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7193842><i>But is it truth?</i>
<SYNC Start=7195758><i>Depends on your point of view.</i>
<SYNC Start=7198508><i>Are you listening, horsemen?</i>
<SYNC Start=7201008><i>When you emerge,</i>
<SYNC Start=7203048>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7203050><i>and you will,</i>
<SYNC Start=7205508><i>I will be there waiting.</i>
<SYNC Start=7208675><i>Because mark my words,</i>
<SYNC Start=7211375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7211383><i>you will get</i><br>
<i>what's coming to you</i>
<SYNC Start=7214425><i>in ways you can't expect.</i>
<SYNC Start=7217005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7217842><i>But very much deserve.</i>
<SYNC Start=7220632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7220633><i>Because one thing I believe in</i>
<SYNC Start=7223842><i>is an eye</i>
<SYNC Start=7225882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7225883><i>for an eye.</i>
