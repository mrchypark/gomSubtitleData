<SYNC Start=3177><P Class=KRCC>
What you guys don't understand is, 
<SYNC Start=4389><P Class=KRCC>
for us, kissing is
 as important as any part of it. 

<SYNC Start=7576><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, right!.......
<SYNC Start=11510><P Class=KRCC>
Y'serious? 

<SYNC Start=13749><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, yeah! 

<SYNC Start=14716><P Class=KRCC>
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 

<SYNC Start=17250><P Class=KRCC>
Absolutely. 

<SYNC Start=18589><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an 
opening act, y'know? 
<SYNC Start=21714><P Class=KRCC>
I mean it's like the stand-up 
comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd 
comes out. 

<SYNC Start=28794><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the 
comedian, it's that-that... 
<SYNC Start=33647><P Class=KRCC>
that's not why we bought 
the ticket. 

<SYNC Start=39057><P Class=KRCC>
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no 
matter how great the show was, 
<SYNC Start=43356><P Class=KRCC>
you girls are 
always looking for the comedian again, y'know? 
<SYNC Start=47427><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... 
basically just trying to stay awake. 

<SYNC Start=53929><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian.
<SYNC Start=56563><P Class=KRCC>
 Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself 
sitting at home, listening to that album alone. 

<SYNC Start=65071><P Class=KRCC>
....Are we still talking about sex?

<SYNC Start=110312><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;





<SYNC Start=121197><P Class=KRCC>
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't 
she seem a little angry? 

<SYNC Start=127033><P Class=KRCC>
Well, she has issues. 

<SYNC Start=129760><P Class=KRCC>
Does she. 

<SYNC Start=131714><P Class=KRCC>
He's out banging other women over the head with a 
club, 
<SYNC Start=133551><P Class=KRCC>
while she sits at home trying to get the 
mastodon smell out of the carpet! 

<SYNC Start=138187><P Class=KRCC>
Marsha, these are cave people. 
<SYNC Start=141402><P Class=KRCC>
Okay? They have 
issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.
' See? 

<SYNC Start=148259><P Class=KRCC>
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife? 


<SYNC Start=149870><P Class=KRCC>
No. No. 

<SYNC Start=151435><P Class=KRCC>
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! 

<SYNC Start=153448><P Class=KRCC>
Okay, okay, yes, it is. 
<SYNC Start=155120><P Class=KRCC>
How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. 
<SYNC Start=158555><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;


<SYNC Start=171296><P Class=KRCC>
Hi. 

<SYNC Start=180376><P Class=KRCC>
So. 

<SYNC Start=182347><P Class=KRCC>
You look great. I, uh... I hate that. 

<SYNC Start=186800><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry. thanks. You look good too. 

<SYNC Start=190109><P Class=KRCC>
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... 
<SYNC Start=198205><P Class=KRCC>
So 
what's new? Still, uh... 

<SYNC Start=200719><P Class=KRCC>
A lesbian? 

<SYNC Start=201605><P Class=KRCC>
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the 
family? 

<SYNC Start=207398><P Class=KRCC>
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh- 

<SYNC Start=210519><P Class=KRCC>
Why- why are you here, Carol? 

<SYNC Start=214089><P Class=KRCC>
I'm pregnant. 

<SYNC Start=215829><P Class=KRCC>
Pregnant?! 
<SYNC Start=218177><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;





<SYNC Start=227990><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company 
where there's some kind of misunderstanding. 

<SYNC Start=235069><P Class=KRCC>
...Then I've already seen this one!

<SYNC Start=238015><P Class=KRCC>
Are you through with that? 

<SYNC Start=239645><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. 

<SYNC Start=244296><P Class=KRCC>
Whose little ball of paper is this?! 

<SYNC Start=246095><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to 
myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I 
balled it up and... 
<SYNC Start=251439><P Class=KRCC>
 ...now I wish I was dead. 


<SYNC Start=254663><P Class=KRCC>
She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know,
 you've already fluffed that- 
 -but, it's fine! 

<SYNC Start=260148><P Class=KRCC>
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them 
any more ammunition than they already have. 

<SYNC Start=263804><P Class=KRCC>
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be 
about the flatness of a child's pillow. 

<SYNC Start=269271><P Class=KRCC>
Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. 
<SYNC Start=275568><P Class=KRCC>
I mean,
 you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. 
<SYNC Start=278751><P Class=KRCC>
And not-not in a good way. 

<SYNC Start=282531><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, calm down. 
<SYNC Start=283684><P Class=KRCC>
You don't see Ross getting all 
chaotic and twirly every time they come. 

<SYNC Start=288337><P Class=KRCC>
That's because as far as my parents are concerned,
<SYNC Start=290088><P Class=KRCC>
 Ross can do no wrong. 
<SYNC Start=291525><P Class=KRCC>
Y'see, he's the Prince. 
<SYNC Start=294083><P Class=KRCC>
Apparently they had some big ceremony before I 
was born. 

<SYNC Start=299149><P Class=KRCC>
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! 

<SYNC Start=300780><P Class=KRCC>
What? 

<SYNC Start=301646><P Class=KRCC>
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! 

<SYNC Start=306068><P Class=KRCC>
Eeaagh! 


<SYNC Start=308346><P Class=KRCC>
Has anybody seen my engagement ring? 

<SYNC Start=309711><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, it's beautiful. 

<SYNC Start=316478><P Class=KRCC>
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... 

<SYNC Start=319643><P Class=KRCC>
No, look, don't touch that! 

<SYNC Start=323732><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having 
to give it back to him... 
<SYNC Start=327233><P Class=KRCC>
'Hi Barry! Remember me? 
I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in 
front of your entire family!' 
<SYNC Start=332750><P Class=KRCC>
Oh God and now I'm 
gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which 
makes it so much harder... 

<SYNC Start=340117><P Class=KRCC>
Easy Rach, we'll find it. 
Won't we! 

<SYNC Start=342069><P Class=KRCC>
Oh! Yeah!

<SYNC Start=346445><P Class=KRCC>
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?

<SYNC Start=347790><P Class=KRCC>
Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 

<SYNC Start=351771><P Class=KRCC>
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... 

<SYNC Start=356998><P Class=KRCC>
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when
 I was in the kitchen with... 

<SYNC Start=361546><P Class=KRCC>
 ...Dinah? 

<SYNC Start=367028><P Class=KRCC>
Ohhhhh, don't be mad... 

<SYNC Start=369646><P Class=KRCC>
You didn't. 

<SYNC Start=370274><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, I am sorry... 

<SYNC Start=371760><P Class=KRCC>
I gave you one job! 

<SYNC Start=374056><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 

<SYNC Start=378936><P Class=KRCC>
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for 
an engagement ring in a lasagne... 

<SYNC Start=384976><P Class=KRCC>
I just... can't do it. 

<SYNC Start=388349><P Class=KRCC>
Boys? We're going in. 
<SYNC Start=393682><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;


<SYNC Start=398896><P Class=KRCC>
.....Hi. 

<SYNC Start=402105><P Class=KRCC>
Wow. That is not a happy hi. 

<SYNC Start=404284><P Class=KRCC>
Carol's pregnant. 

<SYNC Start=405378><P Class=KRCC>
Ooh! I found it! 

<SYNC Start=408861><P Class=KRCC>
W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... 

<SYNC Start=413072><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be 
where I am right about now. 

<SYNC Start=420608><P Class=KRCC>
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, 
huh, Mon? 

<SYNC Start=425496><P Class=KRCC>
Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing? 

<SYNC Start=427990><P Class=KRCC>
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be 
involved, 
<SYNC Start=431095><P Class=KRCC>
but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't 
have to be involved.. 
<SYNC Start=434675><P Class=KRCC>
basically it's totally up to me. 

<SYNC Start=438075><P Class=KRCC>
She is so great! I miss her. 

<SYNC Start=444596><P Class=KRCC>
What does she mean by 'involved'? 

<SYNC Start=446365><P Class=KRCC>
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is 
done. 

<SYNC Start=451352><P Class=KRCC>
Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram
 thing with them tomorrow. 

<SYNC Start=456560><P Class=KRCC>
So what are you gonna do? 

<SYNC Start=457947><P Class=KRCC>
I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still 
gonna be a father. 
<SYNC Start=463279><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;


<SYNC Start=473114><P Class=KRCC>
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
<SYNC Start=476470><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;





<SYNC Start=480109><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. 
<SYNC Start=485470><P Class=KRCC>
Mmm! What's that curry taste? 

<SYNC Start=488624><P Class=KRCC>
Curry. 

<SYNC Start=490870><P Class=KRCC>
Mmmm! 

<SYNC Start=494390><P Class=KRCC>
I- I think they're great! I, I really do. 

<SYNC Start=497770><P Class=KRCC>
Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a 
thing for you, didn't she? 

<SYNC Start=500152><P Class=KRCC>
They all had a thing for him. 

<SYNC Start=503249><P Class=KRCC>
Aw, Mom... 

<SYNC Start=503961><P Class=KRCC>
I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? 

<SYNC Start=506736><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be 
something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. 
<SYNC Start=512387><P Class=KRCC>
Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant- 

<SYNC Start=514443><P Class=KRCC>
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a 
restaurant. 

<SYNC Start=517364><P Class=KRCC>
Well, they don't have to know that... 

<SYNC Start=522975><P Class=KRCC>
Ross, could you come and help me with the 
spaghetti, please? 

<SYNC Start=525463><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. 

<SYNC Start=526587><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. 

<SYNC Start=531626><P Class=KRCC>
I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, 
<SYNC Start=535350><P Class=KRCC>
but, were you planning on bringing up the whole 
baby/lesbian thing? 
<SYNC Start=538556><P Class=KRCC>
Because I think it might take 
some of the heat off me. 


<SYNC Start=544560><P Class=KRCC>
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her 
parents at the club, they were not playing very well. 

<SYNC Start=550096><P Class=KRCC>
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that 
wedding... 
<SYNC Start=552660><P Class=KRCC>
but forty thousand dollars is a lot of 
money! 

<SYNC Start=558150><P Class=KRCC>
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at 
the altar... 

<SYNC Start=564000><P Class=KRCC>
What's that supposed to mean? 

<SYNC Start=565746><P Class=KRCC>
Nothing! It's an expression. 

<SYNC Start=570069><P Class=KRCC>
No it's not. 

<SYNC Start=570969><P Class=KRCC>
Don't listen to your mother. 
<SYNC Start=572081><P Class=KRCC>
You're independent, and 
you always have been! 
<SYNC Start=574015><P Class=KRCC>
Even when you were a kid...
 and you were chubby, and you had no friends, 
you were just fine! 
<SYNC Start=581176><P Class=KRCC>
And you would read alone in 
your room, and your puzzles... 
<SYNC Start=585968><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;


<SYNC Start=587908><P Class=KRCC>
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot 
for the stars, 
<SYNC Start=591267><P Class=KRCC>
with his museum, and his papers 
getting published. 
<SYNC Start=593921><P Class=KRCC>
Other people are satisfied with 
staying where they are- 
<SYNC Start=596529><P Class=KRCC>
I'm telling you, these are 
the people who never get cancer. 
<SYNC Start=600769><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;


<SYNC Start=603336><P Class=KRCC>
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, 
<SYNC Start=605948><P Class=KRCC>
and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem 
to have that problem. 

<SYNC Start=611832><P Class=KRCC>
So, Ross, what's going on with you? 
<SYNC Start=615443><P Class=KRCC>
Any stories? 
No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? 

<SYNC Start=620735><P Class=KRCC>
Okay! Okay. 
<SYNC Start=624480><P Class=KRCC>
Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering 
what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, 
<SYNC Start=631044><P Class=KRCC>
so, well, here's the deal. 
<SYNC Start=635549><P Class=KRCC>
Carol's a lesbian. 
<SYNC Start=639076><P Class=KRCC>
She's living with a woman named Susan. 
<SYNC Start=643274><P Class=KRCC>
She's pregnant 
with my child, 
<SYNC Start=646449><P Class=KRCC>
and she and Susan are going to raise 
the baby. 


<SYNC Start=653096><P Class=KRCC>
And you knew about this?! 
<SYNC Start=656553><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;






<SYNC Start=669667><P Class=KRCC>
Your folks are really that bad, huh? 

<SYNC Start=671560><P Class=KRCC>
Well, y'know, these people are pros. 
<SYNC Start=677076><P Class=KRCC>
They know 
what they're doing, 
<SYNC Start=678229><P Class=KRCC>
they take their time, they get the 
job done. 

<SYNC Start=684111><P Class=KRCC>
Boy, I know they say you can't change your 
parents,... 
<SYNC Start=686805><P Class=KRCC>
boy, if you could- 
-I'd want yours. 

<SYNC Start=692197><P Class=KRCC>
Must pee. 

<SYNC Start=694068><P Class=KRCC>
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. 

<SYNC Start=696481><P Class=KRCC>
You're twins? 

<SYNC Start=697349><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. We don't speak. 
<SYNC Start=698613><P Class=KRCC>
She's like this high-powered, 
driven career type. 

<SYNC Start=701765><P Class=KRCC>
What does she do? 

<SYNC Start=702576><P Class=KRCC>
She's a waitress. 

<SYNC Start=705617><P Class=KRCC>
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. 

<SYNC Start=708465><P Class=KRCC>
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have 
any of this. 

<SYNC Start=711586><P Class=KRCC>
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, 
who... my parents actually preferred. 

<SYNC Start=719537><P Class=KRCC>
The lights, please..
<SYNC Start=720518><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;


<SYNC Start=727724><P Class=KRCC>
...How long was I in there? 

<SYNC Start=730954><P Class=KRCC>
I'm just cleaning up. 

<SYNC Start=733191><P Class=KRCC>
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? 

<SYNC Start=734651><P Class=KRCC>
Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! 

<SYNC Start=743829><P Class=KRCC>
Anyway.. um.. 
So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? 

<SYNC Start=748477><P Class=KRCC>
Oh.. a little.. 

<SYNC Start=750082><P Class=KRCC>
Mm-hmm.. 

<SYNC Start=752360><P Class=KRCC>
A lot. 

<SYNC Start=753114><P Class=KRCC>
Mm. 

<SYNC Start=755088><P Class=KRCC>
So, got any advice? 
<SYNC Start=757559><P Class=KRCC>
Y'know, as someone who's 
recently been- dumped? 

<SYNC Start=761856><P Class=KRCC>
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 
'dumped'. 
<SYNC Start=766236><P Class=KRCC>
Chances are he's gonna be this, this 
broken shell of a man, y'know, 
<SYNC Start=770470><P Class=KRCC>
so you should try 
not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. 
<SYNC Start=777856><P Class=KRCC>
Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give 
Barry back his ring, 
<SYNC Start=782198><P Class=KRCC>
and you can go with Carol and Susan to the 
OB/GYN... 

<SYNC Start=788997><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so 
complicated? 

<SYNC Start=793511><P Class=KRCC>
Got me. 

<SYNC Start=795415><P Class=KRCC>
Remember when we were in high school together? 

<SYNC Start=797330><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. 

<SYNC Start=798563><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet 
somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? 
<SYNC Start=808529><P Class=KRCC>
 ..Ross? 

<SYNC Start=808890><P Class=KRCC>
Yes, yes! 

<SYNC Start=811427><P Class=KRCC>
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. 

<SYNC Start=822988><P Class=KRCC>
Me either... 
<SYNC Start=825227><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;






<SYNC Start=840601><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this 
big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. 


<SYNC Start=847835><P Class=KRCC>
Hi. 

<SYNC Start=848530><P Class=KRCC>
Ross, you remember Susan. 

<SYNC Start=851447><P Class=KRCC>
How could I forget? 

<SYNC Start=852879><P Class=KRCC>
Ross. 

<SYNC Start=853992><P Class=KRCC>
Hello, Susan. 
Good shake. Good shake. 
<SYNC Start=859371><P Class=KRCC>
So, uh, we're just waiting 
for...? 

<SYNC Start=861242><P Class=KRCC>
Dr. Oberman. 

<SYNC Start=862256><P Class=KRCC>
 ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he- 

<SYNC Start=863752><P Class=KRCC>
She. 

<SYNC Start=864266><P Class=KRCC>
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special 
situation? 

<SYNC Start=871637><P Class=KRCC>
Yes, and she's very supportive. 

<SYNC Start=873484><P Class=KRCC>
Okay, that's great. 
<SYNC Start=876696><P Class=KRCC>
No, I'm- Oh.  

<SYNC Start=877788><P Class=KRCC>
Thanks. 
<SYNC Start=880275><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=894450><P Class=KRCC>
Quack, quack.. 

<SYNC Start=898727><P Class=KRCC>
Ross? That opens my cervix. 
<SYNC Start=901625><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=927595><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, well.. 

<SYNC Start=929150><P Class=KRCC>
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging. 

<SYNC Start=931886><P Class=KRCC>
Be right there. 
Be back in a sec. 
<SYNC Start=936120><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;


<SYNC Start=939940><P Class=KRCC>
I dumped him. 

<SYNC Start=942709><P Class=KRCC>
Okay. 
<SYNC Start=945177><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;




<SYNC Start=957991><P Class=KRCC>
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? 
<SYNC Start=962466><P Class=KRCC>
Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important 
decisions have to be made? 

<SYNC Start=966989><P Class=KRCC>
Give me a 'for instance'. 

<SYNC Start=969160><P Class=KRCC>
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about 
with the, uh, with the baby's name? 

<SYNC Start=972298><P Class=KRCC>
Marlon- 

<SYNC Start=973136><P Class=KRCC>
Marlon?! 

<SYNC Start=973988><P Class=KRCC>
 -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl. 

<SYNC Start=978830><P Class=KRCC>
 ...As in Mouse? 

<SYNC Start=981790><P Class=KRCC>
 As in my grandmother. 

<SYNC Start=983406><P Class=KRCC>
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, 
how about, um.. how about Julia? 

<SYNC Start=992497><P Class=KRCC>
Julia.. 

<SYNC Start=994643><P Class=KRCC>
We agreed on Minnie. 

<SYNC Start=996145><P Class=KRCC>
totally, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of 
our lives together. 
<SYNC Start=998748><P Class=KRCC>
Things change, roll with the 
punches. 
<SYNC Start=1001196><P Class=KRCC>
I believe Julia's on the table..? 
<SYNC Start=1003783><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;





<SYNC Start=1006401><P Class=KRCC>
Sorry about that. 
<SYNC Start=1011107><P Class=KRCC>
So. What have you been up to? 

<SYNC Start=1013151><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, not much. I-I got a job. 

<SYNC Start=1017718><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, that's great. 

<SYNC Start=1019224><P Class=KRCC>
Why are- why are you so tanned? 

<SYNC Start=1021587><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba. 

<SYNC Start=1025442><P Class=KRCC>
Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone? 

<SYNC Start=1029108><P Class=KRCC>
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt. 

<SYNC Start=1037717><P Class=KRCC>
Me?! 

<SYNC Start=1038607><P Class=KRCC>
No! 
<SYNC Start=1042437><P Class=KRCC>
I went with Mindy. 

<SYNC Start=1044322><P Class=KRCC>
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?! 

<SYNC Start=1047958><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now. 

<SYNC Start=1051272><P Class=KRCC>
Oh! Well, um.. 
You've got plugs! 

<SYNC Start=1057523><P Class=KRCC>
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet. 

<SYNC Start=1060826><P Class=KRCC>
And you've got lenses! 
<SYNC Start=1063167><P Class=KRCC>
But you hate sticking your 
finger in your eye! 

<SYNC Start=1066062><P Class=KRCC>
Not for her. 
<SYNC Start=1071402><P Class=KRCC>
Listen, I really wanted to thank you. 

<SYNC Start=1074240><P Class=KRCC>
Okay.. 

<SYNC Start=1076257><P Class=KRCC>
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. 
<SYNC Start=1078049><P Class=KRCC>
More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. 
<SYNC Start=1080803><P Class=KRCC>
And I'm an orthodontist. 

<SYNC Start=1082990><P Class=KRCC>
Wow. 

<SYNC Start=1084708><P Class=KRCC>
You know, you were right? 
<SYNC Start=1085969><P Class=KRCC>
I mean, I thought we 
were happy. We weren't happy. 
<SYNC Start=1091240><P Class=KRCC>
But with Mindy, 
now I'm happy. 
<SYNC Start=1096447><P Class=KRCC>
Spit. 

<SYNC Start=1097240><P Class=KRCC>
What? 

<SYNC Start=1098010><P Class=KRCC>
Me. 

<SYNC Start=1101269><P Class=KRCC>
Anyway, um, 
I guess this belongs to you. 
<SYNC Start=1109208><P Class=KRCC>
And thank you for giving 
it to me. 

<SYNC Start=1111069><P Class=KRCC>
Well, thank you for giving it back. 


<SYNC Start=1117559><P Class=KRCC>
Hello?! 
<SYNC Start=1120207><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;





<SYNC Start=1122394><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? 

<SYNC Start=1124400><P Class=KRCC>
Helen Geller? I don't think so. 

<SYNC Start=1127670><P Class=KRCC>
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller. 

<SYNC Start=1130226><P Class=KRCC>
Thank you! 

<SYNC Start=1131588><P Class=KRCC>
No, I mean it's not Geller. 

<SYNC Start=1134203><P Class=KRCC>
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick? 

<SYNC Start=1136028><P Class=KRCC>
No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-
Bunch. 

<SYNC Start=1142046><P Class=KRCC>
Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title? 

<SYNC Start=1145158><P Class=KRCC>
It's my baby too. 

<SYNC Start=1147000><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you 
making any sperm. 

<SYNC Start=1152429><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is! 

<SYNC Start=1155278><P Class=KRCC>
All right, you two, stop it! 

<SYNC Start=1157147><P Class=KRCC>
No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. 

<SYNC Start=1160085><P Class=KRCC>
Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-
Bunch-Geller? 
<SYNC Start=1163679><P Class=KRCC>
'Cause I think that borders on child 
abuse. 

<SYNC Start=1165548><P Class=KRCC>
Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch. 

<SYNC Start=1169616><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? 
<SYNC Start=1171847><P Class=KRCC>
He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, 
<SYNC Start=1173507><P Class=KRCC>
so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his 
way! 

<SYNC Start=1176635><P Class=KRCC>
My way?! You-you think this is my way? 
<SYNC Start=1178687><P Class=KRCC>
Believe me,
 of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my 
life being, 
<SYNC Start=1182268><P Class=KRCC>
this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um,
 this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do- 

<SYNC Start=1186323><P Class=KRCC>
Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea? 

<SYNC Start=1188766><P Class=KRCC>
Yeah. Yeah. A little. 

<SYNC Start=1192325><P Class=KRCC>
Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, 
<SYNC Start=1194795><P Class=KRCC>
but.. thanks for sharing. 
Uh, lie back.. 

<SYNC Start=1198232><P Class=KRCC>
You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. 
<SYNC Start=1199871><P Class=KRCC>
I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this 
particular thing right now. 
<SYNC Start=1204986><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;


<SYNC Start=1215556><P Class=KRCC>
Oh my God. 

<SYNC Start=1216838><P Class=KRCC>
Look at that. 

<SYNC Start=1217918><P Class=KRCC>
I know. 
<SYNC Start=1221580><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;





<SYNC Start=1230096><P Class=KRCC>
Well? Isn't that amazing? 
<SYNC Start=1231696><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1234676><P Class=KRCC>
What are we supposed to be seeing here? 

<SYNC Start=1238271><P Class=KRCC>
I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 

<SYNC Start=1246557><P Class=KRCC>
You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax 
your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 

<SYNC Start=1252729><P Class=KRCC>
Then don't do that, alright? 

<SYNC Start=1253801><P Class=KRCC>
Okay! 

<SYNC Start=1256750><P Class=KRCC>
Monica. Whaddya think? 

<SYNC Start=1259137><P Class=KRCC>
Mm-hmm. 

<SYNC Start=1262473><P Class=KRCC>
Wh- are you welling up? 

<SYNC Start=1263647><P Class=KRCC>
No. 

<SYNC Start=1264800><P Class=KRCC>
You are, you're welling up. 

<SYNC Start=1266710><P Class=KRCC>
Am not! 

<SYNC Start=1267751><P Class=KRCC>
You're gonna be an aunt. 

<SYNC Start=1269016><P Class=KRCC>
Oh shut up! 

<SYNC Start=1271911><P Class=KRCC>
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. 
<SYNC Start=1276870><P Class=KRCC>
I-I saw 
Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, 
it's okay. 
<SYNC Start=1284444><P Class=KRCC>
I hope you two are very happy, I really do. 
<SYNC Start=1287628><P Class=KRCC>
Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, 
<SYNC Start=1291098><P Class=KRCC>
and you guys end up getting married and having 
kids- and everything- 
<SYNC Start=1295220><P Class=KRCC>
I just hope they have his old 
hairline and your old nose. 

<SYNC Start=1303477><P Class=KRCC>
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much
 better now. 
<SYNC Start=1307696><P Class=KRCC>&nbsp;
